"""wlc-utils binding of the repo-agnostic ``mb_cmn.provenance`` helpers.

The vendored provenance functions take an optional ``repo_name`` for the
top-level breadcrumb segment.  These thin wrappers supply this repo's logical
name (``repo_paths.REPO_NAME``) once, so generated-artifact breadcrumbs read
``wlc-utils/...`` even when the checkout dir is a git worktree rather than
literally ``wlc-utils``.

Import this in place of ``mb_cmn.provenance`` -- ``import wlc_provenance as
provenance`` -- and call as before; the call sites stay unchanged.
