    " At times, our degree of certainty about the context is not high,"

    " word. Here, though, it sits on the first letter, the kaf of כִּי, with nothing on the"
    " final yod. Because the grammar checker reads the Unicode-converted source, this"
    " misplacement of the mark is the only defect it can see."
)


_JE_4417_02 = (
    "We detect this in the lexical phase, alongside the unpaired zarqa/tsinnorit stress"
    " helpers, but the violation is really one of intra-word grammar: a rule about where"

    " It is one instance of a broader family of word-level rules we have not yet"
    " implemented in general — every postpositive accent must fall on its word’s final"
    " letter, every prepositive on its first."

_JE_4417_03 = (
    "In the Michigan-Claremont source the defect is actually compound. The mark is coded"

    " than 04, the real, postpositive telisha qetanna; and it is written one letter too"
    " early, on the kaf rather than the yod. The Unicode conversion erases the 24-versus-04"
    " distinction (both become the single telisha-qetanna codepoint), so only the"
    " misplacement survives for the checker; but the M-C also carries the additional coding"
    " error of a 24 stress helper with no 04 for it to help. An argument runs the other way,"
    " though: given that the mark is misplaced onto a nonfinal letter, coding it 04 there"
    " would arguably be worse, since as a 24 the word at least obeys the invariant that 04"
    " falls only on a final letter and 24 only on a nonfinal one. It is not important to rank"
    " exactly how flawed this word is."

_JE_4417_04 = (

    " to the yod, leaving a normal postpositive telisha qetanna on כִּי’s final letter. Being"
    " Unicode rather than M-C, UXLC has only the one telisha-qetanna codepoint to begin with,"
    " so there is no 24-versus-04 distinction for it to recode; relocating the mark is the"
    " whole of the fix."

    " pashta belongs. In both verses the word is finally stressed (and a single-syllable word"
    " like כי counts as finally stressed), so it needs — and should have — no stress helper at"
    " all. The cure is therefore not to supply the helper a “missing partner” accent, but to"
