"""Read the two Decalogues' m-trad strands from BOTH of the repo's sources (issue #68).

The repo holds MAM's manuscript-tradition taxton and elyon Decalogue readings twice over,
and the printed-Decalogue page trio takes the m-trad as its authoritative baseline, so the
two copies had better agree:

* the vendored Hebrew Wikisource data ``in/accgram/printed_decalogue_teamim.json``
  (``tradition: "manuscript"``), which the pages read live; and
* the sibling repo MAM-parsed's ``plus`` subtree, MAM's own parse of its own text.

This module reads each source into the same ``Strand`` shape and diffs them.  Nothing
generates output from it; ``py/tests/test_decalogue_m_trad.py`` is the consumer, so a
refresh of either source that moves a word or a stroke fails the suite rather than
silently invalidating a page's ground-truth claim.

HOW THE STRANDS ARE ENCODED IN THE PLUS TREE.  A verse is a three-cell minirow (C, D, E);
the body text -- and every marker this module cares about -- lives in cell E.  Where the
two strands part company the text sits inside a ``מ:כפול`` template, whose named params are
``כפול`` (the dually-accented text as the great codexes have it), ``א`` (the taxton strand
alone) and ``ב`` (the elyon strand alone).  Text outside any ``מ:כפול`` is shared by both
strands.  Deciding which of ``א``/``ב`` is which needs no appeal to tradition: at Exod 20:2
the ``א`` reading closes on עֲבָדִ֑ים with atnaX and runs on, while ``ב`` closes it with
silluq and sof pasuq -- the taxton and elyon behaviours respectively, and the same pair of
signal accents ``printed_decalogue_strands`` pins the vendored side against.

THE VERTICAL STROKE IS TEMPLATE-BORNE ON BOTH SIDES, NOT LITERAL.  Neither Decalogue holds
a literal U+05C0 anywhere in cell E: every stroke is a ``מ:לגרמיה-2`` (legarmeh) or a
``מ:פסק`` (narrow-sense paseq) template, so the distinction the glyph cannot express is
carried by template identity.  The vendored ``faithful_chanted_verses`` keeps the same
distinction with its own ``{{מ:לגרמיה}}`` / ``{{מ:פסק}}`` (issue #74), where the folded
``chanted_verses`` collapses both to U+05C0.  So the two sources can be checked against
each other at full precision rather than folded together, which is why this module reads
the faithful field and not the folded one.

WHAT "EQUAL" MEANS HERE.  A strand comes back as chanted verses of chanted words, split at
sof pasuq, plus the kind of each stroke in reading order.  Getting there normalizes away
five things, four of them identically on both sides:

* **ketiv/qere is resolved to the qere.**  Deut 5:9's מצותי is a ``כו״ק``; both sides take
  the reading, not the spelling.
* **The qamats variant is resolved to the ד form.**  ``מ:קמץ`` offers a qamats-qatan
  spelling (``ד``) and a plain-qamats one (``ס``); both sides take ``ד``, which is also what
  the vendored folding does.
* **Section divisions are dropped.**  Setumah/petuXah/pisqa markers survive on both sides
  but in different vocabularies (plus writes ``סס``/``ססס``/``פפ``, several of them in cell C
  rather than cell E; the Wikisource base page writes ``{{סס2}}``/``{{ססס}}``/``{{פפ}}``
  inline), so they are not comparable without a mapping this issue does not need.
* **MAM's documentation is dropped.**  ``נוסח`` param 2 is a manuscript note, plus-only.

The fifth is the one asymmetry, and it is the only difference the two sources actually
have.  They put a word's SAME-LETTER MARKS in different orders: MAM-parsed-plus keeps
MAM's own order (shin dot before the vowel, dagesh after it), while the Wikisource base
page is canonically ordered throughout.  It touches 284 of the 613 words and no mark is
added, dropped or altered by it -- only moved within its letter's own run -- so
``compare`` reads both sides in canonical order (NFC, which for Hebrew reorders and never
composes) and ``mark_order_differences`` hands back the untouched pairs so a test can
check that reordering is all that separates them.

What survives is the whole of what the pages actually claim: the chanted-verse
segmentation, every word with every mark on it (accents, vowels, meteg, maqaf, dagesh),
and legarmeh-vs-paseq for each stroke.
