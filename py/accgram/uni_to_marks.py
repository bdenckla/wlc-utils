r"""Extract the Unicode **mark sequence** the PLY scanners consume (issue #9, Phase 2).

The PLY prose/poetic scanners (`ply_scanner` / `ply_scanner_poetic`) read each verse
as a stream of single-character *marks* -- one Unicode codepoint per cantillation
accent (plus meteg/paseq/sof-pasuq/puncta), placeholder ``X`` per base consonant, and
maqaf (``-``) / space word boundaries -- as defined in `accent_marks`.  This module
produces that mark body straight from the canonical ``-kq-u`` Unicode verses.

It is the partial inverse of `wlc_uword.uword`, but only faithful to what the scanner
and `lexical_validation` actually read:

* **Letters** are opaque filler (the rules key on the marks and the word boundaries),
  so each base consonant becomes a single ``LETTER`` placeholder and vowels/points are
  dropped -- real reverse-transliteration is unnecessary.
* **Accents** pass through as their own codepoint.  The five M-C codepoint conflations
  no longer need distinct codes: pashta and telisha qetana keep both their stress-helper
  and their main occurrence (the scanner merges an adjacent same-accent run into one
  token), and the one swallowed secondary -- the non-first of a repeated telisha gedola
  (M-C 44) -- is dropped here.  A telisha gedola that shares a word with a geresh or
  gershayim keeps *both* marks, sequenced in their Unicode (manuscript) order --
  gerstar-then-telg where the pair shares a base letter -- and, where they share a base
  letter, `lexical_validation` whitelists the same-letter pair (`word_to_marks`).
* **Prepositive accents** (yetiv, geresh muqdam, deḥi, telisha gedola) are relocated to
  the front of the word's mark sequence, undoing `wlc_uword._PREPOS_PATT`'s move past an
  accent on the first consonant, so the scanner reads the accents in M-C order.  The one
  exception is a telg + gerstar word, where the telg stays in document order so the pair
  keeps its Unicode (manuscript) order (`word_to_marks`).
* **Boundaries / punctuation** are reproduced exactly: maqaf -> ``-``, inter-word gaps
  -> space, paseq / sof pasuq / puncta as their own codepoints.
* **Ketiv-qere & notes** reproduce the token stream the M-C source presented: the ketiv
  is a swallowed ``*<consonants>`` atom, the qere ``**`` + its pointed body, and
  ``notes`` are appended verbatim (the ``]N`` markers the legarmeh/mayela lookaheads
  key on).

Parity with the Phase-1 outputs is verified by a zero-diff of the git-tracked
``*_ag.txt`` outputs (issue #9, Phase 2).

    Letters become ``X`` placeholders, points are dropped, accents pass through as
    their codepoints, and maqaf / paseq / sof pasuq / puncta are emitted verbatim.
    Prepositive accents are restored to the front of the mark sequence (see
    `PREPOSITIVE_MARKS`).

    One secondary is dropped here: the non-first of a *repeated* telisha gedola (M-C 44).

    A telisha gedola that shares a word with a geresh or gershayim keeps BOTH marks; this
    is the prose analogue of the poetic deḥi + munax whitelist entry -- a legitimate
    same-letter pair spared as a two-token *sequence*, not fused.  For such a telg + gerstar
    word the telisha gedola's prepositive front-loading is **suppressed**, so the scanner
    reads the two marks in their Unicode (manuscript) order: gerstar-then-telg in the three
    same-letter words (Gen 5:29, Zeph 2:15, and -- as a geresh muqdam -- 2 Kings 17:13),
    telg-then-gerstar in the two cross-letter words (Lev 10:4, Ezek 48:10, where the telg
    leads only because it is prepositive and written at the word's front).  The grammar
    accepts both orders (a big telisha freely precedes or follows a geresh -- see
    ply_grammar's geresh_pashta_clause / big_telisha_pashta_clause), so each sequence parses
    cleanly.  Where the two marks share one base letter, the resulting same-letter pair is
    whitelisted in `lexical_validation._WHITELISTED_SAME_LETTER` rather than flagged; the
    cross-letter words already sit on two letters and need no whitelist.  A prose geresh
    muqdam (2 Kings 17:13's companion, and the lone Lev 1:3 case) passes through as its own
    codepoint here and is normalized to a plain geresh by the scanner (see ply_scanner); the
    whitelist therefore lists the raw geresh muqdam codepoint alongside plain geresh.

    Keeping both marks is the most faithful reading -- it preserves both accents the
    manuscript wrote, where dropping either would discard one.  Preserving the Unicode order
    (rather than floating the prepositive telg to the front) keeps the checker's reading
    faithful to the manuscript, which writes the same-letter pairs gerstar-first.  See the
    telisha gedola section of gh-pages/accgram/almost-errors.html (generator:
    accgram/almost_errors.py).
