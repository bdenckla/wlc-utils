r"""Detangle WLC's dually-cantillated prose passages into two single-cant streams (#36).

WLC 4.22 carries three prose loci where each word can bear *two* accents
-- the two readings (תחתון / עליון in the Decalogues, פשוטה / מדרשית in Gen 35:22) merged
into one ``cant-combined``-style stream.  The prose grammar cannot parse two accents per
word, so these verses are excluded from the normal run.  This module *detangles* them:
guided by MAM-simple's already-separated ``cant-alef`` / ``cant-bet`` strands, it splits
WLC's accents into a ``wlc-alef`` and a ``wlc-bet`` stream, each ordinary single
cantillation that the existing prose checker parses.

Throughout, a *chanted verse* is the cantillation unit delimited by a sof pasuq -- which,
in these passages, deliberately does NOT line up with the BHS numbered verse: each
reading carves the text into its own chanted verses that span or subdivide the numbered
verses (the elyon reading chants Exod 20:8-11 as one chanted verse; the taxton reading
makes each its own).  We segment strictly by each strand's own sof pasuq.

Design (all four points verified against the data, see issue #36):

* **Accents come from WLC; MAM is only the oracle** for which accent belongs to which
  strand and where each strand's chanted verses break.  The emitted accent on a word is WLC's
  own codepoint -- so a WLC-specific accent bug still surfaces -- *matched by identity*
  against the accent MAM's strand carries there, never by stored order.
* **Punctuation (maqaf, paseq, sof pasuq) comes from each MAM strand**, which is why
  the loader (``mam_simple_verse``) exposes the strands as their own token streams.  WLC's
  one compromise maqaf pattern fits neither strand; the grammar is boundary-sensitive.
* **Alignment is pairwise** (WLC↔alef and WLC↔bet) on the consonant skeleton, so spelling
  / mater / ketiv-qere differences don't derail it.  Because the loader tokenizes paseq
  and ketiv-qere correctly, the would-be maqaf-join divergences (Exod 20:4 / Deut 5:8)
  collapse to clean 1:1 alignment.
* **Charity, two kinds.**  Where WLC genuinely lacks one strand's accent (it wrote only
  the other reading, e.g. a maqaf-join compaction), that one mark is *supplied* from MAM
  and inventoried (``SuppliedMark``) -- a supplied-mark word parses clean and is NOT an
  ungrammatical verse.  Where WLC instead carries an accent *neither* strand explains (Deut 5:8
  ``תעשה``: a merkha where qadma is due), that is a candidate WLC error: WLC's actual mark
  is emitted (so the grammar reacts) and the discrepancy is flagged (``Anomaly``), never
  silently supplied.  Because WLC's single tangled mark serves *both* readings, such a
  rogue accent is routed into both strands -- as the short strand's substitution where it
  is due an accent, and as a *stray* in the strand that is due none (only a meteg).  The
  one Deut 5:8 merkha is thus the taxton's qadma substitute and the elyon's stray, so it
  surfaces as an ungrammatical verse in *both* readings (two anomalies, one underlying WLC mark).

MAM stress-helpers (zarqa/tsinnorit U+0598, and the doubled telisha / segol / pashta
helpers) are never imposed on the WLC streams: ``_emit_word`` drops the tsinnorit and the
second of any doubled accent.  MAM's metegs are likewise stripped from the emitted
stream (``_strip_nonfinal_meteg``), keeping only the verse-final meteg the scanner reads
as silluq -- the rest are swallowed by the scanner, so dropping them is parse-neutral.

This module is pure computation (no I/O); the driver (``dual_cant_run``) loads the inputs,
writes the trees, and renders the supplied-marks page.

    (``other_meteg`` and it is due no real accent), the leftover is ceded to it, and this
    strand instead *supplies* its own omitted accent (clean, with some manuscript support).
