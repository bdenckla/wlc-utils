"""The "Masoretically-blessed oddities" section of the "almost errors" page.

Legitimate masoretic tradition the checker accepts (not charities), where its
only decision is one of representation.  Two exhibits, each backed by live parse
trees from ``almost_errors_trees``:

  * the **telisha gedola + geresh/gershayim** five-word exhibit, whose alternate-
    reading trees show that the checker's choice (keep both, in the manuscript's
    mark order) is the most faithful of several grammatically-clean options; and
  * **Ezekiel 20:31's mahapakh + qadma**, the only word in Tanakh with two
    conjunctive accents on one letter, where the verdict table shows the fusion
    is all but forced by the grammar; and
  * **Psalms 17:14's double tsinnor**, the Three Books' only run of two
    consecutive identical dividers, which the checker accepts by collapsing the
    repeated divider to one before parsing (the full account links out to the
    standalone deep-dive page).

# The five ways to hand ek20:31's mahapakh + qadma pair to the grammar: the fused token
# the checker actually emits, plus the four alternatives (drop one accent, or keep both as
# a sequence in either order).  Only two parse cleanly: the fused token and the
# qadma-then-mahapakh sequence.
#
# The reason is the *three*-servus context, which is easy to miss.  This pashta (on the
# following word גִּלּוּלֵיכֶם) is served by three conjunctives: a telisha qetanna on the
# preceding word אַתֶּם, then the qadma and mahapakh that share ek20:31's alef.  Every
# pashta_phrase rule for a telisha-qetanna-headed chain puts QADMA directly after the
# TELISHAQETANNA -- TELISHAQETANNA QADMA MAHAPAKH PASHTA, or its one-token analogue
# TELISHAQETANNA MAHAPAKHQADMA PASHTA -- because the masoretic rule is that a telisha
# qetanna is *always* followed by qadma (Yeivin #246).  So here qadma is an obligatory
# bridge, not an optional accent:
#   fused          TELISHAQETANNA MAHAPAKHQADMA PASHTA  -> clean
#   seq_qadma_mah  TELISHAQETANNA QADMA MAHAPAKH PASHTA -> clean (same reading, two letters)
#   drop_qadma     TELISHAQETANNA MAHAPAKH PASHTA       -> no rule (mahapakh can't follow telq)
#   drop_mahapakh  TELISHAQETANNA QADMA PASHTA          -> no rule (qadma needs mahapakh/merkha)
#   seq_mah_qadma  TELISHAQETANNA MAHAPAKH QADMA PASHTA -> wrong order
# A *bare* MAHAPAKH PASHTA rule does exist (a one-servus pashta), so dropping the qadma
# would parse if this pashta stood alone -- but it never does here, because the telisha
# qetanna makes the chain three deep.  The verdict table makes the clean/ERROR split
