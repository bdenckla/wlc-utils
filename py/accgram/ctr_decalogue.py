"""Place CTR's two Decalogues among the idealized strands -- the #69 question, for a DIGITAL
edition rather than a hand transcription.

CTR (``ctr_decalogue_fetch.py``) is a VENDORED STRAND: digital, accent-exact Hebrew, so its
marks are compared mechanically against the reference ``printed_decalogue_teamim.json`` rather
than read off a page.  What it turns out to follow is the surprise this module reports:

* CTR's **Exodus 20** has the ta'am **elyon** accents (not the taxton the running text was
  expected to hold) under a punctuation that is NEITHER strand's: sixteen sof pasuqs, the exact
  UNION of the two strands' boundaries (the elyon's 9 and the taxton's 13, sharing 6).  Nothing
  was re-accented to fit them.  At the 9 elyon boundaries CTR has the elyon's silluq; at the 7
  taxton-only ones it has no silluq at all, the mark standing after the elyon's own mid-verse
  disjunctive (revia, revia, revia, atnaxta, revia, segolta, zaqef, on עבדים / על־פני / לארץ /
  לשנאי / לקדשו / כל־מלאכתך / בשעריך).  So only 9 of the 16 are chanted verses; see the naming
  section below.
* CTR's **Deuteronomy 5** is the **taxton**, chanted-verse division and all: thirteen, matching
  ws/dt/taxton/printed boundary for boundary, which is why that book is clean where Exodus is not.

SAY "SOF PASUQ SPAN", NOT "CHANTED VERSE", FOR THE SIXTEEN (Ben, 2026-07-24).  A chanted verse is
a well-formed cantillation unit, which minimally means a SILLUQ on the last word before the sof
pasuq; a span that, in Ben's words, "doesn't even seem to be trying to obey the rules of
cantillation" is only a sof pasuq span.  Splitting at the mark and calling every result a chanted
verse -- which this module did -- begs the question for exactly the seven spans that are the
finding.  ``sof_pasuq_spans`` is named for this, and ``span_silluq_status`` is what checks it.

The claim the page makes needs that check to be REAL: "the accents are the elyon's, silluq
included, but the punctuation is neither strand's" invites the objection that sinks a sloppier
version of it -- silluq IS an accent, so a genuine re-division would have MOVED the silluqs and
the two halves could not come apart.  They come apart here only because CTR moved nothing.  Note
that the glyph comparison below cannot see this on its own: ``word_glyphs`` drops U+05BD, so
139/142 is silluq-BLIND and would agree just as happily if CTR had re-silluqed the seven.

STATE THE DIVISION IN CHANTED VERSES OR SPANS, NEVER IN NUMBERED ONES.  An earlier draft of the
two bullets above described the Exodus division as "the ordinary numbered-verse division -- a sof
pasuq at every numbered verse".  That is both off-subject and false.  Off-subject because these
pages and this comparison are about chanted verse structure only, numbering being a different
concept (Ben, 2026-07-24).  False because Exodus 20:13 holds FOUR sof pasuqs, which is exactly
where three of the sixteen come from -- ``sof_pasuq_spans`` below says so, and the file
contradicted itself for as long as both texts stood.  Issue #69's Result 11 carried the same
phrasing and was corrected with this.

WHY THE COMPARISON IS AT THE GLYPH LEVEL, NOT THE ACCENT LEVEL.  The eight paper Decalogues of
#69 were HAND transcriptions: a reader resolved each mark to an accent, distinguishing a qadma
from a pashta or a yetiv from a mahapakh by grammar and position -- a distinction the two
members of each pair do NOT draw graphically.  CTR gives no such reading.  Worse, its encoding
is nonstandard (see MAM-basics' review of CTR, ``rocc_2_pre_vowel_accents_in_ctr``): it reuses
one code point for a lookalike pair and leans on vowel-relative order, so its bytes recover the
GLYPH reliably but not always the accent.  So CTR is compared at the resolution its data
actually supports -- the visible mark -- by folding each lookalike pair onto one glyph:

    qadma == pashta,  yetiv == mahapakh,  geresh muqdam == geresh   (tipexa/dexi is poetic-only)

This is not a workaround that hides differences: the accents that DISCRIMINATE elyon from taxton
and p-trad from m-trad (geresh vs pazer, revia vs telisha gedola, zaqef vs revia, and the
chanted-verse boundaries) are not lookalike pairs, so folding the pairs leaves every
discriminator intact.  What the fold gives up is exactly the azla-vs-pashta and
mahapakh-vs-yetiv distinction CTR could not have expressed anyway.

WHAT THE VERDICT CLAIMS.  Only what #69 says survives every transcription -- the chanted-verse
boundaries plus the disjunctive skeleton -- read at the glyph level.  CTR's marks agree with
ex/elyon (Exodus) and dt/taxton (Deuteronomy) at all but a few words, and every disagreement is
CONJUNCTIVE: a munax CTR has on the proclitic atom of a maqaf compound, or a munax/merkha
swap.  None touches a disjunctive.  The cross-strand re-run -- the same comparison against the
OTHER tradition -- is where the evidence is: agreement collapses, which is what rules out the
clean match being an artifact of the fold.
