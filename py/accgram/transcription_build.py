The two jobs of ``doc/edition-transcription-workflow.md`` section 4, which had been done by a
throwaway script rewritten once per transcription -- thirteen of them by the time this was
written (wlc-utils#72).  JOB 1 wraps the editor's downloaded export(s) into the committed
JSON, applying corrections and uncertain readings and adding the ``pages`` wrapper when a
Decalogue spans two printed pages.  JOB 2 derives the .txt body from that JSON through
``edition_transcription.txt_lines``, under the .txt's hand-written header.

THE DUPLICATION WAS NOT HARMLESS, which is why this exists at all.  The last two copies had
already diverged on the trailing-empty-line rule below, and that is a difference in what gets
committed, not in style.  The guarantee that .txt and JSON say the same thing is enforced
mechanically either way (``test_editor_export_and_txt_agree``), so this is ergonomics rather
than safety -- but a rule that lives in a deleted scratch file is a rule the next transcription
has to rediscover.

THE HEADER STAYS IN THE .txt AND IS NEVER REWRITTEN.  Only the body beneath it is derived.
The alternative -- a separate committed header file -- would commit the same prose twice and
invite its own drift, and keeping the header in place is what makes ``--check`` a true
idempotence test: re-derive the body from the committed JSON and the whole file must come back
byte for byte.  ``py/tests/test_edition_transcriptions.py`` runs that check over every stem.

WHERE CORRECTIONS LIVE, and why they are not committed.  ``--corrections`` and ``--uncertain``
take throwaway files (write them in the gitignored ``.novc/``), not a git-tracked sidecar per
stem.  The committed JSON is already the durable record: an applied correction keeps the
superseded reading in ``corrected_from``, so both the new reading and the old one are in the
audit trail, and a tracked sidecar would be a third copy of the same two strings -- the same
argument that keeps the header out of its own file.  The supported re-run is therefore
``--derive-only`` from the committed JSON, not a rebuild from raw Downloads exports; a rebuild
is possible but is a fresh reading of the correction list, not a replay of one.
