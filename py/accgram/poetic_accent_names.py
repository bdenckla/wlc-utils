"""Canonical token-type names for the POETIC (Three Books) accent grammar.

Single source of truth for the poetic PLY *token type* strings, so the (variable,
dot-losing) ASCII transliterations are spelled exactly once instead of as bare
string literals scattered across ply_grammar_poetic, ply_scanner_poetic,
mam_poetic_accents, xcheck_poetic and their tests.  Import these and compare/use
the constants; never re-type the literal.

One unavoidable exception: PLY builds the grammar from the *docstrings* of the
``p_*`` rule functions, which it parses textually -- the terminal names there must
be written literally and cannot be constants.  The ``tokens`` tuple is built from
these constants, and the grammar's parse / zero-conflict tests fail loudly if a
docstring terminal ever drifts from a constant, so the literal docstrings stay
pinned to this file.

Transliteration choices (avoid proliferating spellings; follow existing precedent):
Spellings follow the canonical display names in ``py/mb_diff_mpu/describe_diff.py``
(ACCENT_NAMES / POETIC_ACCENTS), uppercased with its ``ḥ`` written **X** for ASCII:
  - deḥi -> DEXI, munaḥ -> MUNAX (ḥ -> X; cf. mb_cmn ``DEX``).
  - tsinnor -> TSINNOR (describe_diff "tsinnor", doubled n).
  - merkha -> MERKHA, mahapakh -> MAHAPAKH (cf. Unicode names; the prose Goerwitz
    "MEREKA"/"MAHPAK" lose the kaf).
  - names describe_diff spells plainly keep the prose Goerwitz form (ply_grammar.py):
    SILLUQ, PAZER, LEGARMEH, AZLA, GALGAL, REVIA, SHALSHELET.

Maintainer overrides of describe_diff:
  - ATNAX, not ETNAXTA (describe_diff calls the accent "etnaḥta").
  - TARXA, not TARHA: describe_diff's plain "tarha" is a bug; the ḥet takes X.
  - ILLUY, not ILUY: doubled L preferred.
  - OLEH_WEYORED keeps "we-" (no "veyored" precedent in the tree).

NOTE: the prose grammar (a port of the Goerwitz C oracle acc2tre.y) keeps ATNACH /
MUNACH / MEREKA / MAHPAK / TARHA-as-TIFCHA; the poetic vocabulary intentionally
diverges to the spellings above.
