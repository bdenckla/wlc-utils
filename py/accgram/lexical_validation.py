"""Prose lexical validation: flag unpaired stress-helper accents (alphabet errors).

This is a *prose-only* layer that sits on top of the faithful C-port scanner/
grammar (prose_scanner / prose_ply_grammar) and intentionally **diverges from the
goerwitz C oracle**, in the same documented spirit as the MISSING_SOFPASUQ and
tevir/tipexa recoveries: where the C lexer silently swallows a malformed accent,
we surface it as an ungrammatical verse.

The one helper handled today is accent ``82``.  In the prose accent system, ``82``
is well-formed *only* as the left half of a ``82{TEXT}02`` pair fused onto a single
maqaf/space-delimited atom, where the scanner reads it as one ZARQA token
(prose_scanner ``(?:82{TEXT}02)?02``; TEXT = ``[^ \\r\\n-]*`` keeps the pair inside
one atom).  When there is no ``02`` later in the same atom, the C lexer's
``35|75|95|44|05|82|52 -> None`` rule swallows the ``82`` and the intended accent
simply vanishes -- so whether the verse becomes an ungrammatical verse is left to downstream
parse luck.  All 12 such prose verses (a stray zarqa mis-encoded before a lamed
ascender) are equally wrong; this layer flags them uniformly.

A second, sibling check (``illegal_same_letter_pairs``) flags an impossible
*same-letter* configuration rather than an unpaired helper: two accents stacked on one
base letter.  This is a WHITELIST guard, the prose analogue of the poetic
``poetic_scanner`` bang guard (Plan D / Plan E): two masoretically-blessed clusters
may legitimately share a letter -- the MAM-confirmed ek20:31 ``mahapakh!qadma`` (fused to
one token, grammar-accepted) and the telisha gedola + geresh-family pair (gn5:29, zp2:15,
2k17:13), spared as a two-token *sequence* (the telg and the geresh, in manuscript order --
gerstar-then-telg for these same-letter words) -- so ANY other two adjacent
accents (no base-letter ``X`` between -> same letter) is an alphabet error.  The sole
attested illicit pair is mahapakh + tipexa (lv25:20); two accents stacked on one letter
make the fault intrinsic to the letter -- an alphabet error, not an illegal grammatical
sequence (which the grammar would otherwise flag as ``tipexa_phrase -> ERROR``, the
wrong rationale).  The general guard supersedes the earlier mahapakh+tipexa-only check
(output-neutral today, but future-proof; cf. memory parse-rate-not-a-goal).

Prose-only is intentional and burns no bridge: a bare ``82`` is *valid* in the
poetic accent system (tsinnorit, >200 uses), but the genre split already happens
upstream (accgram.prose_filter strips Psalms/Proverbs/poetic-Job before scanning),
so within this prose pipeline a bare ``82`` is unconditionally illegal.  A future
poetic checker is expected to have its own lexer where ``82`` is a first-class
token; this module therefore hard-codes prose semantics with no genre parameter.

A third check (``nonfinal_telisha_qetannas``) flags the lone medial telisha qetanna
(M-C ``24``) of je 44:17.  In M-C this is an unpaired stress-helper exactly like ``82``:
a ``24`` (medial telisha qetanna, written on a non-final letter) is well-formed only
as the helper of a following ``04`` (the real, postpositive telisha qetanna), the pair
``24{TEXT}04`` -- which the scanner fuses into one TELISHAQETANNA token.  But the
grammar checker reads the *Unicode-converted* source, where M-C ``24`` and ``04`` are
the **same** codepoint (telisha qetanna, U+05A9): the helper/main code distinction has
been erased, so the only checker-visible defect is *placement* -- a telisha qetanna
sitting on a non-final letter (here the kaf of כִּי) rather than on the word-final
letter (the yod).  This is therefore phrased as a word-internal placement rule: a
telisha qetanna on a non-final letter, with no following telisha qetanna to absorb it
as a stress-helper, is illegal.  (It is one instance of a broader, not-yet-implemented
family of word-level rules -- every postpositive accent must fall on the final letter,
every prepositive on the first.)

The module is self-contained: it reads the per-atom Unicode mark stream straight from
the verse body (the scanner-ready marks ``uni_to_marks`` produces), with no dependency
on the scanner internals.  It is kept general enough that other unpaired stress-helpers
could be added later; today ``82`` and the lone ``24`` are wired up (the remaining
siblings -- standalone ``44`` and the codes ``11``/``12`` -- were judged moot after the
Phase-2 Unicode port; see the tracking GitHub issue).
