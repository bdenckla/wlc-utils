r"""Reconcile the poetic scanner's token stream with two corrections WLC's
Michigan-Claremont source cannot express on its own.

The poetic scanner (``ply_scanner_poetic``) reads each verse from the M-C accent
codes alone.  Two distinctions are simply not *in* that encoding, so the scanner
makes a blanket guess that this module corrects before the grammar sees the tokens:

1. **legarmeh vs paseq.**  A conjunctive (azla 63 / mahapakh 70) followed by a paseq
   (05) is written identically whether it is a legarmeh (a disjunctive) or a
   narrow-sense paseq (the conjunctive stays a servus and the bar is a bare pause).  The scanner
   emits ``LEGARMEH`` for *every* such sequence.  MAM-simple, by contrast, encodes the
   distinction structurally (``lp-legarmeih`` vs ``lp-paseq`` nodes), so we treat MAM
   as the oracle: where MAM reads a narrow-sense paseq we demote the scanner's ``LEGARMEH``
   back to its underlying conjunctive servus (the paseq is then swallowed, as such a
   paseq always is).  This is the poetic counterpart of the prose scanner's
   has_legarmeh rule+exception list, but data-driven from MAM rather than hardcoded.
   (A future project, gh issue, may replace the MAM oracle with a poetic rule that
   needs only a small hardcoded exception list -- see doc / the issue.)

2. **the unmarked oleh-we-yored** (Yeivin ITM #363).  L sometimes writes the yored of
   an oleh-we-yored as a bare merka (71) with the upper ole sign dropped, so the
   scanner reads a conjunctive merka and misses the divider.  ``ply_scanner_poetic``
   already recovers the cases its galgal-servus heuristic can see; the rest are
   recovered here by *charitable parsing*: if a verse does not parse, but reinterpreting
   exactly one of its merkas as an (unmarked) yored makes it parse, adopt that reading.
   This consults no oracle -- only the grammar -- and touches only verses that would
   otherwise be NO_PARSE, so it can never change a verse that already parses.

The two passes run in order (demotion first, then charitable parsing): at Ps 68:20 and
Pr 30:15 both corrections are needed, and the merka the charitable pass promotes is the
word immediately after the demoted legarmeh -- independently reproducing MAM's reading.
