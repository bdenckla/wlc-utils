"""Check a hand transcription against its vendored Wikisource strand, before it is committed.

Usage:
    # a transcription still in progress, from the editor's downloaded exports
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_edition_transcription.py check \
        ~/Downloads/simtiq_dt_elyon_p208-transcription.json ... --key dt elyon printed

    # one already committed, taking its Wikisource strand from the .txt header
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_edition_transcription.py check --stem simtiq_dt_elyon

    # what all eight strands do at one site, located by letter skeleton
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_edition_transcription.py check --site השבת לקדשו

This is the loop that runs between the transcriber typing a page and the transcription being
committed: resolve what was typed, align it against the strand, and report every difference
WITH the printed page and line it came from, so the page can be re-read at that spot.

THREE THINGS IT REPORTS, AND WHY EACH IS SEPARATE:

* Differences, with the reference word each sits on.  Not every difference is a cantillation
  difference -- where the two texts divide words differently the marking usually follows -- so
  the word is printed alongside and the classification stays a human judgement.
* Chanted verse boundaries, counted on both sides AND checked for difference regions touching
  a silsof.  A bare count would miss one boundary moving while another appeared.
* Pasoleg positions AND kinds.  The folded ``chanted_verses`` collapses legarmeh and
  narrow-sense paseq onto the same U+05C0 glyph, but ``faithful_chanted_verses`` keeps them
  apart (issue #74), so the reference now says both WHERE a stroke stands and WHICH kind it is
  -- and the transcription's own legarmeh/paseq claim is checked against it, not only against
  glyph shape.  Comparing the placements doubles as an alignment check: these are independent
  anchors, so several landing on their exact indices rules out a drifting diff.  The two sides
  index DIFFERENT token streams, so a transcribed pasoleg is mapped through the diff into
  reference coordinates before any comparison -- an insertion upstream of one would otherwise
  shift it off its reference position and the report would blame the pasoleg.  An edition that
  does not distinguish the two kinds (Koren) prints ``unspecified`` and no kind is compared.

An unresolvable abbreviation is held as ``???`` rather than guessed, so the alignment still
runs and the reference's own token at that spot can be shown as CONTEXT for the transcriber's
decision -- never as a substitute for it.  Reading the accents is the transcriber's job; this
tool displays, aligns and reports.

BEWARE the asymmetry this loop has.  It flags only positions where the two already disagree,
so only those get re-read.  A "no divergences" result means no divergence survived a procedure
that never inspects the agreeing majority, and compensating errors are possible in exactly
this material -- see the Exodus elyon's two cancelling divergences in wlc-utils#69.
