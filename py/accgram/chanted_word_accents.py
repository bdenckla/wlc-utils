r"""Survey: chanted words with two or more accent TOKENS, over the prose verses of the Tanakh.

A chanted word normally has one accent.  ``maqaf_nonfinal_accents`` measured one corner of the
exceptions -- an accent on a non-final atom of a maqaf compound -- and left the larger half
unmeasured, because a chanted word can also have two accents while being a single atom, and can
have both of them on a compound's final atom.  This module measures all of it, and sets Yeivin's
own inventory of the phenomenon beside the measurement so each checks the other.

Pure computation and a JSON writer -- no HTML.  Run via
``main_accgram.py survey-chanted-word-accents``.

TOKENS, NOT MARKS, and that choice is the design.  The prose scanner already fuses several
written pairs into one token: a doubled stress helper (pashta, telisha qetana), a tsinnorit with
its tsinnor, the same-letter ``mahapakh!qadma`` cluster, munax + U+05C0 as legarmeh, and
qadma...zaqef as ``METHIGAZAQEF``.  It also swallows meteg, emitting ``SILLUQ`` only for a
verse-final U+05BD before sof pasuq.  Counting tokens therefore disposes of every confound that
would otherwise have to be special-cased -- a stress helper written twice is not two accents, and
neither is a metigah-zaqef.  One confound survives and is handled here: a geresh or gershayim
written twice on one chanted word is ONE accent written twice, and the scanner does not fuse it.
``_fold_repeated_geresh`` folds such a repeat, and ``geresh_folds`` names every place it fired.

ATOM AND CHANTED WORD (issue #81).  An atom is one written word, between spaces or maqafs; a
chanted word is a lone atom or a whole maqaf compound, and is the unit an accent marks.  Yeivin
states outright that the two take the same rules -- ITM §302, quoted in ``YEIVIN_ENTRIES`` -- so
this survey counts both together and records which kind each hit is, rather than treating the
compound as a separate phenomenon.  Maqaf is the last rung of the one scale of separating force
(``maqaf_nonfinal_accents``' ``MAQAF_IS_THE_LAST_RUNG`` in ``printed_decalogue_strands``), not a
second ledger.

THE MARK BODY IS BUILT HERE, ATOM BY ATOM, and the WLC build is checked against
``uni_to_marks.verse_to_marks``.  The scanner reads a mark body, and a token's position is an
offset into it, so the chanted-word boundaries have to be offsets into the same string: a space
ends a chanted word and a maqaf (``-``) is an atom boundary inside one.  ``verse_to_marks``
returns the body alone, with no way back to the Unicode a chanted word came from, so
``_verse_units`` rebuilds it fragment by fragment and keeps each fragment's Unicode beside its
marks.  For WLC the rebuild is asserted equal to ``verse_to_marks``' own output, which makes the
alignment a checked fact rather than a claim.  ``word_to_marks`` is applied per ATOM in all three
corpora, as ``verse_to_marks`` applies it per verse element, so its front-loading of a prepositive
accent never crosses an atom boundary and never moves an accent onto a neighbouring atom.

THE THREE CORPORA, and what each can be asked.  WLC 4.22 and UXLC are diplomatic -- the
Westminster transcription of the Leningrad Codex, and that same transcription corrected -- so
neither is a second hand.  MAM-simple is a consensus text.  A claim about what the accentuation
DOES therefore takes MAM, and the Yeivin cross-check below is run against MAM alone; WLC's and
UXLC's counts are here so the divergence between a manuscript and a consensus text can be read
off, not so that three columns can be averaged.

Prose verses only, routed by ``prose_filter.should_keep_line``.  Yeivin's inventory below is his
prose inventory; the poetic system puts two accents on one chanted word far more readily and
systematically (Breuer, Chapter 9 §§20-26), so a merged count would say nothing about either.
