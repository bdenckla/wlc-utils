"""Genuine SAT focus-word table for the poetic ungrammatical-verse report (issue #10).

The "SAT" table is goerwitz.html's per-witness focus-word table: the WLC focus
word against its UXLC and MAM-simple readings, with inline WLC bracket-notes and
an accent description (its columns are: Hebrew value | WLC bracket-notes | accent
description | witness key). The acronym itself is not expanded anywhere in the
codebase.

This module reuses the prose enrichment + renderer (rtms_data.build_enriched_row,
rtmsr_sat.render_sat_table) to reproduce that table on the poetic page, and is
split out of poetic_oddballs so that module stays focused on ungrammatical collection
and page assembly. The poetic page localizes the focus to the verse-final word
(the missing-silluq locus); NO_PARSE verses have no single focus word and so get
no SAT table.
