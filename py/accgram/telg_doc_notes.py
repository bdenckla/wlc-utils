"""Generate gh-pages/accgram/telg-doc-notes.html -- a deep-dive translation of
MAM's documentation (נוסח) notes on the five telisha-gedola + geresh/gershayim
words: Genesis 5:29, Zephaniah 2:15, 2 Kings 17:13, Leviticus 10:4, and
Ezekiel 48:10.

This is the companion "deep dive" for the telg + gerstar exhibit in
almost-errors.html: that page argues the checker's representation choice; this
page renders, into English, what MAM's own variant-notes say about each word.
It is the telg analogue of ps17v14-mam-doc-notes.html (the Psalms 17:14 notes).

Following MAM-with-doc's published sigil policy, manuscript sigils and technical
accent names are kept in Hebrew and explained (see the key) rather than replaced
with a Latin-letter system, and the implicit subject "MAM" is supplied where a
note opens with "=".  The verbatim Hebrew of each note is shown too, drawn
byte-exactly from MAM-with-doc via telg_mam_doc_notes.json, so the English
rendering can be checked against the original.
