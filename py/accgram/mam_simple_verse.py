    INSIDE an atom rather than between atoms, and per-node tokenization splits the atom
    at each of them:

    * ``letter-large`` / ``letter-small`` / ``letter-hung`` -- a letter written large,
      small or suspended, wrapped with the rest of its atom in an ``slh-word``.  Genesis
      1:1 came out as בְּ and רֵאשִׁ֖ית, Leviticus 13:33 as וְהִ֨תְ, גַּ and לָּ֔ח.  These

      MAM-simple's own reference handlers do with them (``py-examples/osis/
      osis_handlers.py`` passes each straight into the surrounding run).

      it.  Emitted as a token of its own it reached ``_join_on_maqaf`` after that atom had
      been closed, and so attached FORWARD: Psalms 106:1 came out as הַ֥לְלוּ and ־יָ֨הּ,
      two chanted words with the maqaf at the front of the second, where MAM has the one
      chanted word הַ֥לְלוּ־יָ֨הּ.

    targeted scroll-difference note, whose unpointed commentary and pointed specimen both
    reached the stream as tokens.  Exodus 17:16's one-atom כֵּ֣סְיָ֔הּ is a specimen quoted
    from the Aleppo Codex inside such a note, and it read as a chanted word of the verse;
