r"""Generate gh-pages/accgram/printed-decalogue.html -- the printed-tradition Decalogue
grammaticality report (issue #52).

Companion to the dual-cantillation work of issue #36 (which grammar-checks the *manuscript*
taxton/elyon strands by detangling WLC): this page reports whether the *printed tradition*'s
(דפוסים) taxton and elyon accentuations of the two Decalogues parse under the same prose
grammar checker.  It renders live from ``printed_decalogue.check_all`` over the vendored
readings, so it can never drift from the checker's real behaviour.

It also lays out the four cantillation strands of the opening אנכי...מצותי span (manuscript /
printed x taḥton / elyon) over that span's shared frame and its two signal words, resolved by the
shared ``printed_decalogue_strands`` module.  The Simanim and Koren companion pages
(``printed_decalogue_simanim_page``, ``printed_decalogue_koren_page``) link back to that table
rather than duplicating it.

The strands are IDEALIZED, and since issue #52's transcription work the page also says, in one
paragraph, how the twelve hand-transcribed real Decalogues fare under the same checker: eleven
give their strand's verdicts at every chanted verse -- four of them by printing the p-trad elyon's
ungrammatical merged opening verse, which is what stops that finding being an artifact of the
idealization -- and one departs.  Those counts come live from ``transcription_parse.check_all``,
and the per-Decalogue verdicts stay on the two satellite pages, which is where they are
documented; the hub must not assert what a satellite does not.

Editorial / style conventions for the rendered prose are single-sourced in
``printed_decalogue_strands`` (bare-Hebrew strand names תחתון / עליון in output, romanized only
in ``title`` / ``alt`` attributes and internal keys; ``ROM_*`` accent names never retyped; real
em dashes).

Run via ``main_accgram.py generate-html``.

# The nesting tables (issues #59, #62)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Two transposed strand tables over the SAME opening region (commandments 1-2, the 51 words
# אנכי...מצותי): one for the printed tradition (pE/pT), one for the manuscript tradition (mE/mT),
# so the reader can compare how each tradition's elyon and taxton verses nest. The layout echoes
# the table in MAM-simple/gh-pages/versification-and-cantillation.html (the source of the analogy,
# not of the text), but with no M/B verse-number rows. Each cell is a first…last range (letters
# + accents; vowels/dagesh/ordinary-meteg stripped), green where a column begins one of the
# strand's verses and red where it ends one. The columns are the finest common subdivision: the
# union of both strands' verse boundaries. Because the p-trad taxton breaks at every boundary
# either m-trad strand uses, BOTH tables end up with the same five columns (widths 9,5,14,17,6);
# what differs is which column edges are true verse starts/stops. Where a verse straddles a column
# edge of the other strand (the m-trad taxton's אנכי...על־פני crossing the elyon's break after
# עבדים) the cell shows a start with no matching stop, or vice versa — the "straddling" that makes
# the m-trad nesting less tidy than the p-trad's clean five-in-one. (M/B numbering is dropped because the two traditions
# split this region differently, so no single verse-number row aligns with the columns; issue #59.)

# Appendix: the grammaticality-irrelevant תחתון differences
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Spun out of the verdict paragraph's parenthetical (which now just links here): a plain-prose
# catalogue of how the p-trad and m-trad תחתון differ WITHOUT touching grammaticality (several DO
# change the parse tree — e.g. a disjunctive-rank accent swap — but leave both strands well-formed).
# Both strands parse clean everywhere, so none of this bears on the page's question; it is here only
# to substantiate the verdict's point that these differences never cost either strand its
# grammaticality. The prose is hand-written documentary colour, not part of the live grammaticality
# result; but the Hebrew it displays for the Deuteronomy differences — where the תחתון cantillation
# differences cluster, in the Sabbath commandment — is pulled live from the data and reduced, again
# live, to just the stretch the two strands accent differently (_sabbath_diff_table), so it can't
# drift from the text the page grammar-checks. The verse-boundary difference (p-trad first verse
# ending at מבית עבדים) and the boundary accents it drags along are the verdict's own point and are
# deliberately NOT repeated here.

# The prose books' conjunctive accents (Yeivin ITM §194, encoded once in mb_cmn.hebrew_accents);
# every other cantillation accent is disjunctive. Used only to verify, live, that each displayed
# line really does end on a disjunctive.

_ACCENT_HI = ord("\N{HEBREW ACCENT ZINOR}")  # U+05AE, last (meteg U+05BD is excluded)

# The three shared boundaries at which the differing stretch is broken into aligned line-pairs.
# Each is a letter skeleton (cf. _SPAN_COLUMNS) that ends a line in BOTH strands and carries a
# disjunctive accent in both — the only kind of point where a break keeps the m-trad and p-trad
# lines aligned. These three (of the stretch's shared disjunctive boundaries) give three ~even
# pairs. _split_into_lines asserts each lands, in order, and is genuinely disjunctive, so any drift
# in the vendored accents fails the build instead of silently mis-breaking.
