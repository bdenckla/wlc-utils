"""Hand-authored structured research notes for poetic oddballs.

The poetic oddball set is small and closed, and most cases need no hand
annotation: the mechanically auto-derived WLC-vs-MAM-simple summary
(``poetic_oddball_summary.derive_tentative_summary``) is the relevant datum.
This module is the optional prose-style annotation layer for the few oddballs
that warrant more — the poetic analogue of the per-book ``ob_notes_*`` modules
the prose ``goerwitz.html`` report consumes via ``ob_notes.get_structured_text``.

Entries are keyed by the two-letter ``bb`` reference form ("jb 31:15") that
``poetic_oddballs._bb_ref`` produces, and may carry the same fields the prose
report understands. The poetic report currently renders:

  * ``st-summary``      -- a hand-authored summary, shown alongside the
    auto-derived one (labelled to distinguish the two).
  * ``comment``         -- review prose; a string, or a list/tuple of items
    (each item a string or a sequence of inline HTML contents) rendered one
    paragraph apiece (see ``rtmsr_media.render_comment_paragraphs``).
  * ``uxlc_note_page``  -- external tanach.us UXLC note URL, linked next to the
    Mwd/UXLC reference links.
  * ``github-issue``    -- external GitHub issue URL, linked likewise.
  * ``img``             -- a Leningrad-Codex image filename under ``gh-pages/img/``
    (the ``LC-<folio>-col-<n>-line-<n>-<ref>.png`` form), shown with an auto-derived
    source caption; ``Da-at Miqra img`` / ``Aleppo img`` add a captioned companion
    image (see ``rtmsr_media.render_image_paragraphs``).

# NOTE: Ps 17:14 (the unique double tsinnor) once had an entry here, but the
# checker now accepts that verse (ply_grammar_poetic.parse_tokens_accepting_repeats
# collapses the repeated divider), so it no longer surfaces as a poetic oddball and
# this layer can no longer render notes for it.  Its manuscript / MAM / Breuer
# discussion, plus the LC and S1 images, now live on the hand-authored page
# gh-pages/accgram/ps17v14-double-tsinnor.html.
