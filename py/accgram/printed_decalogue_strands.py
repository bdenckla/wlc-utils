r"""Shared computation for the two printed-Decalogue pages: the four cantillation strands
of the Exodus Decalogue's opening אנכי...מצותי span, resolved live from the vendored data.

This module is pure computation -- no HTML, no display/editorial vocabulary in its *return
values* -- so both companion pages can depend on it without either depending on the other:

  * ``printed_decalogue_page`` (issue #52) grammar-checks the printed vs manuscript Decalogue
    accentuations and now also lays out the four strands as a styled range table.
  * ``printed_decalogue_simanim_page`` (issue #62) documents Simanim's Tiqqun as an independent
    printed-tradition edition and links back to the four-strands table on the main page.

Each of the four Exodus readings (m-trad / p-trad x taḥton / elyon) is read from
``in/accgram/printed_decalogue_teamim.json`` (Hebrew Wikisource data): the leading chanted verses
covering the אנכי...מצותי span are pulled from the data, and the accents on אנכי, עבדים and
על־פני are derived from the marks, so the strands can never drift from the data.
``resolve_readings`` pins each derivation against ``READING_SPECS`` / ``STRUCTURE`` and raises
``AssertionError`` on any divergence -- this build-fails-on-data-drift behavior fires at page-1
generation and in the tests, and must never be softened to a warning.  ``resolve_pausal`` and
``check_tirtsax`` do the same for the appendix's vowels: the pausal alternation at על־פני and מתחת,
and the vocalization of תרצח in all eight readings.

Editorial / style conventions for the rendered prose (agreed with Ben; keep them when editing
any page they govern).  This list is the repo's home for them -- ``CLAUDE.md`` points here.

SCOPE.  The bullets divide into two kinds, and the difference matters when a rule is invoked
somewhere else.  TRIO-ONLY: the strand names in Hebrew letters, "signal word", the maqaf scale,
the scoped "no difference anywhere", the ``ROM_*`` single-sourcing and its italic wrapping, the
two Simanim editions and their determiner, and the attribute exemption -- all of these are about
the printed-Decalogue pages' own subject matter.  REPO-WIDE, and applied to every accgram page:
atom vs chanted word, "cantillation" over "accentuation", the real em dash, and never opening an
English sentence with a Hebrew word.

* **The two chant-strands are named in Hebrew letters -- תחתון / עליון -- NEVER transliterated
  and NEVER translated.**  No "taḥton"/"elyon" and no "upper"/"lower" in the output: the
  upper/lower glosses invite confusion with above-letter vs below-letter accents, which is *not*
  what the names mean, and for a reader who doesn't know the terms no gloss beats a misleading
  one.  The full ``טעם תחתון`` / ``טעם עליון`` appears ONLY at first mention; everywhere after,
  drop the טעם -- bare עליון is read as "the [טעם] עליון".  The romanized "taḥton"/"elyon" survive
  only as *internal keys* (``READING_SPECS`` / ``STRUCTURE`` names) and inside ``title`` / ``alt``
  attributes; render via the ``TAHTON`` / ``ELYON`` string constants (or ``render_reading_name``).
  Verbatim quoted source Hebrew (e.g. ``בלא טעם עליון``) keeps whatever it says.  This is a
  cross-repo rule (cf. MAM-basics ``py/versification_and_cantillation/doc.py``).
* Prefer "**cantillation**" to "accentuation".
* **Never a loose "word": say "atom" or "chanted word" where one of them is meant** (issue #81).
  An ATOM is one written word, the thing a maqaf joins to the next; a CHANTED WORD is either a
  lone atom or a whole maqaf compound -- the unit cantillation operates on, normally bearing one
  accent.  Two of the Shabbat commandment's three signal words are compounds, and על־פני is one,
  so the trio's central claims are about chanted words and saying "word" leaves them uncheckable.
  Name a compound whole (על־פני, לא־תעשה), never a bare half of one.  ``MAQAF_IS_THE_LAST_RUNG``
  introduces "atom" to the reader with an appositive gloss, which is what licenses the bare term
  elsewhere on the pages.  Plain "word" survives only for an ordinary English word ("in other
  words", "a great many Hebrew words take one vowel where the reading pauses") and inside quoted
  or translated source material, which keeps whatever it says.
* **"Signal word" is the trio's ONE term for a chanted word whose accent tells strands apart** -- it
  replaced the older "milestone word", which said only "notable position" and not "this is where
  you look".  It now names TWO distinct sets, and the pages must never collapse them into one
  claim: (a) within the אנכי...מצותי span, עבדים and על־פני, whose accent PAIR uniquely identifies
  which of the four strands a text has (see ``resolve_readings``' pairwise-distinctness check);
  and (b) at the Deuteronomy Shabbat commandment, the trio of disjunctively accented chanted words that
  tells p-trad accents from m-trad ones (see ``SHABBAT_SIGNAL_SHORTHAND``).  Their jobs are
  complementary, not redundant -- the doctrine is spelled out at that constant.  אנכי and מצותי
  are the span's shared frame, NOT signal words: every strand starts at the one and ends a
  chanted verse at the other, so neither distinguishes anything.
* **ONE scale, with maqaf at the bottom of it -- there is no second ledger for maqaf
  differences.**  A verdict measures how far down that scale a Decalogue's agreement with its
  Wikisource strand reaches: chanted verse boundaries, then the disjunctive skeleton, then the
  conjunctives, then the maqafs.  A maqaf an edition adds or drops IS a difference in how the
  text is marked --
  the mildest one there is, since a maqaf separates its atom from the next even less than a
  conjunctive does -- and it is counted ONCE, at the atom whose marking changed, never as a
  regrouping plus an accent.  So a verdict cell names the first rung that breaks and what breaks
  it, and "every accent" is never said with a maqaf difference tucked underneath it.  The scale is
  stated to the reader verbatim on all three pages via ``MAQAF_IS_THE_LAST_RUNG``: splice that
  constant, don't paraphrase it.  Its guardrail comment records the convention this replaced (a
  2026-07-25 audit fix that made maqaf differences non-differences) and why that one was wrong.
* **Never write a bare "no difference anywhere" in a verdict cell; scope it, "no difference
  anywhere the comparison reaches".**  What backs these cells is a hand transcription of the
  printed ACCENTS, so "anywhere" can only ever mean "anywhere the comparison reaches", and an
  unscoped phrasing invites a reader to take it for the whole page.  Two things fall outside.  A
  maqaf, which the .txt line records but the token stream drops: ``koren_dt_elyon`` joins לא־תעשה
  where its Wikisource strand sets the two atoms apart, and since Koren accents BOTH atoms of the
  compound the two sides emit the same two tokens, so a zero-divergence result is not evidence of
  no difference.  (That blindness is a gap
  now that the scale above counts such a difference; making maqaf a token of its own is issue
  #75.)  And the POINTING: the two תחתון strands part at תרצח in a vowel and nothing
  else, qamats m-trad against patax p-trad on the same tipexa, which the diff cannot see in either
  book.  The scoped phrasing costs one word and is true; the bare one was already false once (the
  Koren Deuteronomy appendix row, 2026-07-25 claim audit finding 3).  Where a vowel or a maqaf HAS
  been checked off the page, say so in the cell and put the evidence in the transcription's
  ``.txt`` comment block -- that is a primary observation about the edition, not something the
  harness establishes, and no test will defend it.
* **Accent/mark romanizations are single-sourced as ``ROM_*`` constants** (pashta, tipeḥa,
  etnaḥta, revia, segolta, silluq, sof pasuq, meteg, maqaf, legarmeh, paseq, the two vowels of
  the pausal alternation, + a few compounds).
  They are shared by the ``_ACCENT_NAMES`` derivation table, the ``READING_SPECS``
  expected-accent pins, and the prose of all three pages -- so a printed name can't drift from
  the derived one.  Don't retype these spellings inline; ``tests/test_transliterations.py``
  guards them tree-wide.  (``_CP_*`` = the codepoint constants, distinct from the ``ROM_*`` word
  forms.)  They stay PLAIN ``str`` here on purpose: ``_accent_of`` returns them and
  ``READING_SPECS`` compares them, so they must never become HTML.
* **Every romanized accent/mark name renders italic, inside ``<span class="romanized">``**
  (``gh-pages/style.css``; matching the MAM-simple island, which italicizes every such term).
  The pages do the wrapping, not this module -- each aliases the ``ROM_*`` strings through
  ``py_html.my_html_span_romanized.rmn`` ONCE at module level, so every prose site is styled
  without a per-site call (settled as issue #65, finding C2).  This is why the wrapped aliases
  are HTML nodes, not strings, and so cannot be interpolated into an f-string -- splice them
  into a contents tuple instead.  Book/apparatus terms (Tiqqun, ḥumash, Keter, qere/ketiv,
  pisqa) are NOT accent names and stay unwrapped; so does the ``pashta_phrase`` code identifier,
  which is a checker error name rather than a transliteration.
* **A bare "Simanim" never names an edition.**  Feldheim publishes two that this trio reads --
  the *Simanim Tiqqun* (the tiqqun qorim; Decalogues on pp. 83-84, 208-209, 246, 247) and the
  *Simanim Tanakh* (pp. 119-120, 297-298, 350, 351) -- and they do not even agree: the Tiqqun is
  p-trad and the Tanakh m-trad.  The repo's vocabulary predates the second, so an unqualified
  "Simanim" reads as the Tiqqun by historical accident alone.  Write **SimTiq** / **SimTan**
  (lowercase ``simtiq`` / ``simtan`` in identifiers and transcription stems) in code, comments,
  docstrings, tests and docs; in RENDERED prose write the full "Simanim Tiqqun" / "Simanim
  Tanakh", or a bare "the Tiqqun" once the passage has named it, since the shorthand is repo
  jargon that a reader of a published page has not met.  Two things a bare "Simanim" may still
  do: name the *page* (``printed-decalogue-simanim.html`` documents BOTH editions, so "the
  Simanim page" is right), and name the publisher or both books at once ("the two Simanim
  editions", "no digital Simanim edition exists").
* **The edition name takes a determiner in running prose: "the Simanim Tiqqun" or "Simanim's
  Tiqqun", never a bare "Simanim Tiqqun prints ...".**  "Simanim" is the publisher, not part of
  a title, so it is doing a possessive's work; the bare noun-noun compound instead reads as a
  fixed brand name.  Contrast "Koren", which by metonymy IS the edition's name and so correctly
  takes no determiner ("Koren has X at Y" is fine, "Simanim Tiqqun has X at Y" is not).  Between
  the two forms, prefer the ARTICLE whenever a genitive follows -- "the Simanim Tiqqun's own
  stance", not the double-genitive "Simanim's Tiqqun's own stance" -- and the possessive when it
  parallels a neighbouring "Koren's Classic Tanakh".  EXEMPT, because they are reference tags
  rather than sentences: citation labels and the captions/headings built on them ("Simanim
  Tiqqun p. 83: the Exodus main Decalogue in the elyon"), ``img alt`` text, and image filenames.
* Rendered prose uses the **real Unicode em dash** ``—`` (U+2014), not ASCII ``--`` (``--`` is
  fine in code/comments/docstrings, like this one).
* **Never open an English sentence with a Hebrew word** (Ben, 2026-07-25).  "תרצח is that same
  alternation…" became "With תרצח, we have that same alternation…"; give the sentence an English
  runway and let the Hebrew arrive inside it.  A sentence-initial RTL run makes the reader resolve
  the direction switch before there is any English context to switch back to, and at a paragraph
  start there is not even a preceding word to anchor it.  Scoped to *English* prose: a quoted
  Biblical verse, a Hebrew-language note (``telg-doc-notes``) and the Hebrew cells of a table all
  begin with Hebrew and are untouched by this.  As of that date the trio and its sibling accgram
  pages have no other violation, so any new one is newly introduced.
* **Attribute contexts are EXEMPT from the Hebrew-letter rule, by design -- do not "fix" them.**
  Romanized "taḥton"/"elyon" is correct, and stays, inside ``img alt`` text and ``abbr title``
  text (and any similar attribute); only *visible prose* takes the Hebrew letters of bullet 1.
  Reasons: an alt/title string is announced by screen readers and copied into plain-text
  contexts, where ASCII romanization survives and a bidirectional Hebrew run does not; and an
  attribute is no place to mix alphabets.  So the trio's hover/screen-reader text being romanized
  while its prose is Hebrew-lettered is a deliberate asymmetry, NOT an inconsistency to clean up
  (settled as issue #65, finding T1).  Recorded here because it keeps getting re-litigated.

  **There are exactly TWO exempt registers: attributes and internal keys.**  Compact *notation*
  in visible prose is NOT a third one -- an axis gloss like ``(two books x TAHTON/ELYON x
  m-trad/p-trad)`` is visible prose and takes the Hebrew letters via the constants, however
  terse or schematic it looks.  (Only the strand words are governed; ``m-trad``/``p-trad`` are
  tradition abbreviations, not strand names, and stay as they are.)

# follow one strand purely: Simanim's Tiqqun follows the p-trad תחתון's chanted verse boundaries
# throughout, yet has the m-trad accents at the Shabbat commandment of its Deuteronomy appendix
# Decalogue.  The span pair cannot catch that -- it is an accents-only departure that moves no
# boundary the pair reads.  The Shabbat trio can, because it compares accents at a commandment
# the two traditions divide into chanted verses identically.  So: עבדים and על־פני place a text
# among the four strands within אנכי…מצותי, while the Shabbat trio tells p-trad accents from
# m-trad accents where an edition can stray from its nominal tradition.  Neither makes the other
# redundant, and no page may imply that it does.

# verdict table.  Plain ``str``, not HTML: splice it into a contents tuple.
#
# WHY IT IS SAID AT ALL (2026-07-25 claim audit, finding 3).  The trio used "every accent" two
# ways at once.  Koren's Exodus appendix Decalogue was credited with "Every accent. The only two
# differences are of word division", while the summary directly under the same table counted that  # prose-ok: quotes the replaced convention
# very Decalogue as the one of four that "does NOT follow its strand in every accent" -- and the
# Deuteronomy appendix one was credited with "no difference anywhere" although it joins לא־תעשה
# into a maqaf compound where its Wikisource strand sets the two atoms apart.  Both readings were
# available and the page contradicted itself.
#
# WHY THIS ANSWER AND NOT THE FIRST ONE (Ben, 2026-07-25).  That contradiction was first settled
# the other way, by declaring a maqaf difference to be no accent difference at all -- a second
# ledger, kept apart from the accents.  That convention was wrong, and wrong in a way the repo
# had already ruled on: ``supplied_marks``' punctuation intro tells its own reader that maqaf is
# "so tightly coupled" to the lack of an accent "that detangling accents and detangling
# punctuation can be regarded as one and the same activity", and ``printed_decalogue_taxton_diff``
# already counts a maqaf difference as one ordinary difference SITE.  The real problem the old
# convention solved was double counting -- reporting a split compound as a division AND as a new
# accent -- and the honest fix is that those were never two facts.  One atom's marking changed.
# So: one scale, maqaf at the bottom of it, each difference counted once at the atom it sits on.
#
# WHY IT NAMES ATOMS AND CHANTED WORDS (issue #81).  A maqaf sits on an ATOM and joins it to the
# next; what the two of them become is one CHANTED WORD.  An earlier wording called both of those
# "the word", so the one sentence that exists to draw the distinction used a single noun for both
# sides of it.  This is also the trio's introduction of "atom" to the reader -- the appositive
# gloss is why it can be used bare on the pages afterwards.

# The pausal alternation at על־פני and מתחת
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Why the main page's appendix wants these two words at all.  The appendix's one Exodus difference
# between the two תחתון strands is a VOWEL -- qamats m-trad against patax p-trad at תרצח, on the
# same tipexa -- and that pair of vowels is not arbitrary: it is the pausal alternation, the
# general rule for which (Yeivin ITM §199) is that the pausal vowel goes with etnaxta and silluq
# and the contextual one with every other accent.  על־פני and מתחת are where the Decalogue shows
# that rule doing exactly what it says: at both, the תחתון has the pausal qamats under the heavier
# accent its own verse division gives the word, and the עליון the contextual patax under a lighter
# one.  So the appendix can say what makes תרצח the odd case -- there the two strands have the SAME
# accent, so the rule does not decide the vowel and the two traditions differ.
#
# The pins below are what license the appendix's claim that neither of these two words is a
# p-trad-vs-m-trad difference: ``resolve_pausal`` derives the (vowel, accent) pair at both words
# from ALL EIGHT readings and requires each to match its strand's pin, so the claim is checked on
# every generation rather than asserted once.  Keyed by (skeleton, reading) -- the vowel and the
# accent both turn on the strand alone, identically in Exodus and Deuteronomy and in both
# traditions, which is the whole point.
