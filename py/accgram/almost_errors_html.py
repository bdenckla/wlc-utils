"""HTML coordinator for the "almost errors" page.

Holds the report title, the page-level intro, and ``render_body_contents``,
which threads the two top-level sections together in document order:

  * ``almost_errors_charities`` -- the "Editorial charities" section; and
  * ``almost_errors_oddities`` -- the "Masoretically-blessed oddities" section.

The small shared render helpers live in ``almost_errors_html_shared``; the "real
computing" (parse trees and verdicts) lives in ``almost_errors_trees``.

It shares goerwitz.html's stylesheet + width-limited shell and the shared
error-tree table renderer (``ob_tree_table``), so a later merge with the
prose/poetic reports is mechanical.
