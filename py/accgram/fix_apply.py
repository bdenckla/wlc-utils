"""Apply a MAM-simple fix to a WLC verse at the Unicode-word level, for re-testing.

The fix-tester wants to ask: *if we adopt the MAM-simple value here, does the
ungrammatical clear?*  The fix is a Unicode word-diff (``diff_wlc_mam``) and the scanner
reads a Unicode mark body, so this module bridges the two the
direct way (issue #9): it locates the single changed word in the verse's
``vels`` by index-aligning to the WLC word tokens, substitutes the MAM Unicode word
in place (keeping the surrounding structure -- ketiv-qere wrappers, ``notes``,
section markers), and re-transcodes the modified verse to a mark body
(``uni_to_marks``) for re-scanning.  No accent-name->code bridge is involved; the
transcoder owns the helper/main split and every mark emission.

An adjacent run of words (a multi-word ``wlc_focus``) is substituted word by word.
A change the grammar cannot see -- a vowel- or medial-meteg-only edit -- is returned
as an ``UntestableFix`` (it would re-transcode to the same body), as is a non-adjacent /
mismatched-count multi-word diff or a word/atom misalignment.  Nothing is guessed.

An accent that *moves* to a different letter (je 44:17: a telisha qetanna shifting from
the kaf to the yod) keeps the per-word accent multiset but is grammar-visible -- it is
exactly what ``lexical_validation`` keys on -- so it is treated as a real, testable
change: the whole-word substitution carries the mark to its new letter and the
re-transcoded body re-scans with the move applied (``AppliedFix.moved_accents`` records
the from/to letters for the report).
