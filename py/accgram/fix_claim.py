"""Read the human claim in an oddball's structured-text note (ob_notes_*).

The fix-tester cross-checks its mechanical verdict against what the hand-authored
``st-summary``/``comment`` *claims*.  Speculative claims ("I think the checker
wants...", "the scanner prefers merkha rather than munaḥ") are the ones most worth
testing, so this module flags them and makes a best-effort guess at the claim's
direction (does it expect adopting MAM to fix the verse?).  Direction inference
from free prose is unreliable, so it is advisory only -- the report shows it next
to the mechanical result and lets a human adjudicate disagreements.
