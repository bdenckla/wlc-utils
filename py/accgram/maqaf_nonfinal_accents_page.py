r"""Generate gh-pages/accgram/maqaf-nonfinal-accents.html, and the JSON behind it.

The rendered account of ``maqaf_nonfinal_accents``' survey, narrowed to one question: how often a
non-final atom of a compound has an accent of its own in MAM, and what that means for
``koren_dt_elyon``'s ``mun-mun`` on לא־תעשה.  Every number on the page is spliced from the survey
this run computes, and the same run writes ``out/accgram/maqaf-nonfinal-accents.json``, so page
and data cannot drift.

The survey is wider than the page: three corpora, both genres, and a route (a)/(b) split telling
an inherited secondary accent from a maqaf written after an atom that keeps its own conjunctive.
The page rendered all of that until 2026-07-27 and now renders MAM's prose alone -- see issue #83
for what was cut and why, and #82 for the Yeivin citations that must be settled before the
route-(b) material is rendered anywhere again.

Rendered-prose conventions are ``printed_decalogue_strands``' module docstring; the romanizations
come from its ``ROM_*`` constants and are never retyped here.

Run via ``main_accgram.py generate-html-maqaf-nonfinal-accents``.

# "Non-final atom of a compound", not "proclitic" and not "maqaf-joined atom".  "Proclitic"  # prose-ok: names the rejected term
# asserted a grammatical role the scan never checks -- route (b) is precisely an atom that keeps
# its own conjunctive, so it is proclitic by position only.  And a lone atom is never "maqaf-joined"  # prose-ok: names the rejected term
# full stop: it is joined TO the next one, or else the two of them are joined to each other.
# Naming the atom by its POSITION in the compound says what the scan measures and nothing more,
# and it matches the module basenames.  (#81's sweep settled "atom" as a reader-facing term,
# which is what lets it stand bare in the body.)
#
# THE TITLE NAMES THE QUESTION, NOT THE SCAN (Ben, 2026-07-30).  It was "Accents on a Non-Final
# Atom" -- the survey's own subject, the thing the tables count.  But the survey is the means:
# the intro asks whether Tanakh has anything like the three strange spreaders of Koren's
# Deuteronomy and the Simanim Tiqqun's Exodus, and every table under it is answering that.  So
# the title says what the page is FOR.  ("Accents on a Non-Final Atom" had itself dropped "of a
# maqaf compound" for space earlier the same day, an atom being non-final only within one.)
# The basenames -- this module, the survey, the HTML, the JSON -- keep the scan's name, which is
# what they are named for.
#
# THE BARE "SIMANIM" IS DELIBERATE; DO NOT "FIX" IT TO "the Simanim Tiqqun".  Raising it was
# right and Ben settled it, 2026-07-30: "I consider it an acceptable breaking of the rule on the
# basis of the need for brevity in a title", and then, more exactly, "it is a strange spreader in
# a simanim edition" -- the word is the PUBLISHER here, one of the senses that survive bare.  He
# also stated the governing test: distinguishing the Tiqqun from the Tanakh "is only critical ...
# where there would be possibility of confusion, e.g. in a document discussing both", and this
# page's Simanim material is the Tiqqun's alone.  Even a document that DID discuss both would
# keep the exception "where from context it is clear or, as in a title, where context *will* make
# it clear" -- a title is read with the page under it.  The body prose still names it in full.

# Ben, 2026-07-27: "Ditch WLC and UXLC; I don't think I ever asked for that scope.  MAM='The
# Tanakh', for the purposes of this document."  A claim about what the accentuation DOES wants a

# GONE with the classification (Ben, 2026-07-28): _CONFIG_DISPLAY, which rendered Yeivin's
# category names, and the two labels for the rows that held the cases the categories could not
# name or could not reach.  The unnamed one read "no named configuration: the mark is simply not
# at that atom's own accent position" -- "too long for a cell, and anyway I have no idea what
# [it means], and it features your favorite, usually meaningless word: own".  Both faults are
# moot now: with the rows gone there is no cell, and a table of observed pairs has nothing to
# say about where an accent would otherwise have fallen.
#
# The naming rules those labels carried are worth keeping even though the labels are not:
#   * "the mayela", never "the mayela tipexa" -- mayela IS the name for what would otherwise be
#     a tipexa there, so the pair reads as a kind of tipexa.  Mayela is to tipexa as metigah is
#     to qadma, and nobody writes "metigah qadma".
#   * No "secondary" in a rendered label: unexplained, the page never saying what a secondary
#     accent is, and arguably unwarranted, Yeivin calling every mark on his list secondary where
#     Breuer (CoS ch. 9 §§21-23) reserves the word for pairs that cannot stand in that order
#     across two separate words.  Naming the two marks asserts neither view, which is the point.

# Where an accent has a name of its own in the position the pair puts it in, the row uses that
# name.  A tipexa in the chanted word of an etnaxta or of a silluq is the MAYELA; a qadma in the
# chanted word of a zaqef qatan is the METIGAH.  Ben's own analogy -- mayela is to tipexa as
# metigah is to qadma -- and he asked the same question of both rows in turn: "what happened to
# the terminology of mayela?", then the same of metigah.  The intro still glosses metigah-zaqef
# as a qadma before a zaqef qatan, which is what tells a reader which mark the row means.
#
# Single-sourced, because the prose under the table names them too, in the sentence that gives
# Breuer's rule for which pairs a maqaf can stand after: a cell and a sentence spelling the same
# position differently is the drift the ROM_* constants exist to stop, and these two names are
# not among them (they are positions a mark takes, not marks).

# The SECOND accent's cell, where one mark goes by two names and the row cannot choose between
# them (Ben, 2026-07-29: 'name the cell "ger./az." and explain either right before or right after
# the table what that means').  A geresh on a chanted word stressed on its last syllable is
# called an azla, so the qadma-geresh row's 99 may be of both kinds -- and unlike metigah and
# mayela above, which are conditioned on the neighbouring ACCENT and so are decidable from what
# the survey records, this one is conditioned on STRESS, which it does not record.  Hence both
# names in the cell rather than a choice, and ``_geresh_or_azla_note`` under the table.
#
# WHAT THE THREE BOOKS ACTUALLY SAY, settled 2026-07-29 over two passes of the full OCR corpora
# and recorded here rather than left in a session transcript.  The question was Ben's: is the
# qadma of a qadma-geresh chanted word "usually called azla", narrowly, in that context?  He then
# corrected himself from his own copy of Jacobson -- it is the GERESH that is sometimes called
# azla -- and the search bore that out:
#
#   * JACOBSON, "Chanting the Hebrew Bible" (2nd expanded ed.), is the ONLY one of the three that
#     conditions the name on stress.  Glossary: azla is (1) another name for geresh, when the word
#     it is on is stressed on the last syllable, and (2) another name for kadma.  Body, p. 187:
#     strictly only mille'el words take a geresh, so some call the combination "kadma azla" when
#     the second word is millera'; and in some traditions kadma azla is sung to a different melody
#     from kadma geresh.  His own footnotes cite Binder, Abraham W., "Biblical Chant", New York:
#     Sacred Music Press, 1959, 52-53; and once, for Esther, Zeitlin, Shneur Zalman, and Haim
#     Bar-Dayan, "Miqraey qodesh: The Megillah of Esther and Its Cantillation" (in Hebrew),
#     Jerusalem: Kiryat Sefer, 1974, 88-91.  NOTE his worked example is the
#     combination across TWO words (Numbers 7:11); the glossary sense is stated of the mark
#     generally, which is what covers this row.
#   * YEIVIN, ITM, draws a stress distinction but names its two sides GERESH and GERSHAYIM, not
#     azla (§265): geresh on a word with penultimate stress, or on any word preceded by azla
#     (Genesis 11:31 penultimate, Genesis 22:6 final); gershayim on a final-stress word preceded
#     by no servus or by munax.  His standing name for the conjunctive is azla throughout, and he
#     never uses "qadma" as an English name.
#   * BREUER, CoS, states no stress condition on azla at all.  His geresh entry (§26.d) says some
#     call it azla, on shape grounds; §39.e explains azla against pashta by shape and by tune, and
#     kadma as the servant that "precedes" the azla.  His own stress-conditioned rule in this area
#     is geresh vs gershayim (ch. 5 §9), where "azla" does not appear.  His standing name is kadma.
#
# So the three do not CONFLICT: Jacobson adds a distinction the other two do not make, which is
# why "in some traditions" is in the rendered note and why the note cites him alone.  Ben:
# "I'm comfortable resting on Jacobson's terminology; to me it doesn't contradict Yeivin or
# Breuer; it just adds a distinction that they don't make."
#
# AND NO SURVEY OF MARKS CAN DECIDE IT.  Unicode has no geresh-versus-azla distinction: its only
# geresh flavors are plain geresh (U+059B, which INCLUDES azla), geresh muqdam (U+059D, poetic --
# in MAM the revia mugrash component), and gershayim (U+059C).  Neither Yeivin nor Breuer uses
# the term "geresh muqdam" anywhere.  MAM's prose verses have no ``qad-germ``, so this row is
# entirely plain geresh -- which settles the codepoint and never the name.

# EVERY Hebrew cell on the page gets it, not just the one Ben happened to be looking at.  He had

# about frequently ... this should just be sort of obvious, that (unless the whole table is

# The class is in gh-pages/style.css beside th.numeric/td.numeric, and centering is the one

    MAM's prose verses, in the order both tables below use, each with its three counts and an
    example of the spreader and simple ones.

    A CONCENTRATOR COUNT, NOT A THIRD TABLE (Ben, 2026-07-30: "the concentrators seem to belong
    to neither of these tables ... Which table would they fit into most seamlessly ... Or should
    they have their own table?").  A column, and in BOTH tables, because it costs neither of them
    a single row: all nine pairs a concentrator has already had one, three of them in the
    spreader table and six in the appendix.  A table of their own would have restated nine rows
    that are already on the page and split one pair's three counts across two places.  The
    ``concentrator_by_pair`` keys are in the row set all the same, so a corpus bump that produced
    a pair NO spreader and NO simple chanted word has gets a row of its own rather than vanishing
    from a total -- which the two tables' concentrator totals then assert.

    Rows are what the data holds, not a list from anywhere: the page reports the pairs that
    occur and no longer says which of Yeivin's categories each case falls under (Ben,
    2026-07-28).  Every compound hit lands in exactly one row, which ``_pair_table``'s total
    asserts.

    THE SIMPLE COUNT COVERS EVERY PAIR, since 2026-07-28.  It used to be restricted to the
    eight pairs the compound side has, because two marks on a chanted word are not always two
    accents and this scan has no accent tokenization to tell them apart.  ``simple_exclusion``
    now does tell them apart, mechanically and in the survey rather than here, so the count
    can be honest and complete at once: what it leaves out is counted, and ``_exclusion_note``
    says what and how much.  Ben's rule for the widening: leave out the pairs that are not
    meaningful -- a stress helper is not a second accent -- and disclose the exclusions.

    ONE ORDER FOR BOTH TABLES, settled here so the split cannot make them disagree.  Pairs
    sharing a first accent stay together rather than scattering by count (Ben, 2026-07-28, of
    the two mayela rows: "these should be listed together instead of strictly ordering by # of
    occurrences").  Groups run commonest-group-first, rows within a group commonest-first.  The
    count that orders them is the ROW TOTAL, all three counts together: ordering by the spreader
    count alone would put the commonest pair on a chanted word -- munax before zaqef qatan, 1,374
    of them -- last, on the strength of its single spreader.  The concentrator count joined that
    total when it joined the rows: a row now shows three counts, and ordering by two of them
    would be a rule nothing on the page states.

    literally a footnote) listing these exclusions, for transparency".  So it is an ordinary
    paragraph under a table, in the page's voice, and each count comes out of the survey.

    WHICH TABLE it goes under is ``_appendix_section``'s docstring; it stopped being the prose
    section's on 2026-07-29.

    IT IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE APPENDIX'S OWN OPENING, Ben having merged the two wordings on
    2026-07-30 -- "two accents on the same letter" (which is what the exclusion is keyed on,
    where "two accents graphically" left the reader to guess what the graphical fact was) and
    "both accents likely belong to the same syllable" (which is why, stated once rather than as
    a doubt about what is not clear).  ``_one_letter_appendix_section`` says the same in the
    shorter form the appendix can afford, having just named the words.  Reword one and reword
    the other.

    IT NO LONGER NAMES THE MARKS, since the same day.  It used to spell out how many of the
    words were a geresh or gershayim with a telisha gedolah and how many a mahapakh with a
    qadma, which is now the appendix's Acc1/Acc2 columns and its Type column; a sentence that
    itemizes a table two sections down is a sentence a reader has to hold in their head.

    THE STRESS-HELPER EXCLUSION IS NOT MENTIONED, though ``simple_exclusion`` applies it and
    the survey counts it.  A first pass opened this paragraph with it -- so many words in which
    the two marks are a stress helper and the accent it helps, one accent written twice.  Ben:
    that is "a deep implementation detail that should not be mentioned.  No one would think,
    'oh how would you deal with zarqa stress helpers? were there none in MAM, or just not
    included in this table?  Of course they are not included in this table, that is obvious and
    therefore you don't have to make a methodological note'."  A reader takes a stress helper
    for granted; what they would not take for granted is two marks on ONE letter, which is why
    that one keeps its sentence.  (He also rejected the naming: the pair is conceptually a
    zarqa stress helper before a zarqa, the ``tsinnorit``/``tsinnor`` names being Unicode's
    misnaming rather than the accents'.)

    The total the paragraph used to open with went with the stress-helper sentence.  It was
    every simple chanted word with two different marks, so quoting it would leave a reader to
    subtract, find a remainder this paragraph does not explain, and go looking for the very
    detail Ben cut.

    # here exists to defend a sentence, and outlives it only as a trap for a later reader.

    # Two facts it carried are worth keeping even though the assertion is not:
    #   * It was PROSE ONLY, deliberately.  The intro once said "not in poetic ones" too, and
    #     the poetic verses do bear it out -- but only among compounds whose maqaf is WRITTEN,
    #     and Breuer has the poetic maqaf after a secondary mark customarily left unwritten, so
    #     a compound accented alike twice with an unwritten maqaf is invisible to this scan.
    #     Ben, 2026-07-27: drop the clause rather than qualify it.
    #   * Two assertions about Isaiah 40:7 had stood beside it, that it is the single compound
    #     whose non-final atom has a munax and that it pairs that munax with a zaqef qatan.  The
    #     verse is still on the page, as the compound example in the table's munax-before-zaqef

    """The scans behind the intro's table, as an appendix at the page's foot.

    Every cell of that table is lifted or constructed from a vendored Wikisource strand, so the
    table states the page's claim about each edition without ever showing the printing.  These two
    figures are the printing those claims are read off -- each a crop of one or two printed lines,
    with the strange spreaders boxed.  The heading says "cropped, highlighted scans" for that
    reason: it was "the printed pages" (Ben, 2026-07-31), which promised whole pages.

    AN APPENDIX, not part of the intro (Ben, 2026-07-31: "let's banish these two new images to an
    appendix").  They sat directly under the printed-case table when they were first rendered.
    The table is the intro's answer and the scans are its evidence, and evidence set apart from
    the argument it supports is what an appendix is for.

    NOTHING CUES IT.  The intro does not link down to this section, matching the two prevalence
    sections, whose comments say why: a rendered section that previews a later one is the hub
    sentence Ben has cut from these pages before, and an appendix heading announces itself.  The
    one link that does run down the page, from the prose section to the one-letter appendix, is
    the exception rather than the pattern.

    ``img_class="ink-on-white"`` on both: each is black ink on white paper and wants the
    stylesheet's dark-mode inversion.

    ONE CLAUSE PER CAPTION (Ben, 2026-07-31): which edition, which Decalogue, which strand, which
    page, and what is highlighted.  Each caption used to splice the forms themselves out of the
    vendored strands and then say in prose that each has an accent on both atoms, and the Tiqqun's
    added a sentence about the printed line break falling inside its לא־תעשה.  All of that is
    already in front of the reader: the intro's printed-case table shows the same forms, derived
    the same way, and the boxes on the scan show where they are and that one of them is in two
    pieces.  So this is NOT a place to reinstate the "show it in Unicode, not only in words" rule
    -- the Unicode is shown, one section up and in the image, and the captions are the labels on
    the evidence.  Nothing here derives anything, which is why ``printed_cases()`` is no longer
    called: the "re-derived rather than handed down" guard the call carried belongs to the table,
    which still has it.

    THE TWO PAGE CITATIONS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT PARALLEL, and "appendix p. 246" would be wrong.
    Koren's appendix restarts its own page numbering, so "p. 39" names nothing unless "appendix"
    qualifies it.  The Simanim Tiqqun's p. 246 is an ordinary number in the book's one overall
    sequence, and its appendix is merely where in the book that page falls -- hence the aside.

# GONE: "What is counted", whittled to one sentence over two days and then cut outright (Ben,

# said -- the question is whether a compound has an accent other than the one on its last atom
# -- the intro already says, in the same words, as the thing the page counts.  A section that
# restates the intro is not a definition, it is an echo.
#
# What went before it, each cut for a reason worth keeping:
#   * A paragraph calling the space-delimited unit a chanted word and then arguing that
#     splitting on spaces gives chanted words -- assuming the premise and proving it.  It also
#     taught a shape notation (qad-zaq, 0-mer-sil) used nowhere else on the page.
#   * A paragraph saying a meteg and a silluq are one sign and that it counts as an accent only
#     verse-finally.  "Useless internal implementation explanation.  Also, super obvious.
#     Basically saying: I'm not an idiot."  The rule lives in atom_accents' docstring, where a
#     reader of the code needs it and a reader of the page does not.
#   * A sentence saying a compound counts once however many of its atoms are accented, and is
#     counted against every maqaf compound in those verses.  "Nitty-gritty details of counting
#     at a level of detail not of concern to my model of who the reader is."  It lives in
#     ``scan``.
# Every rule they stated still governs the count; none of them was ever page text's job.


# GONE: "Which text this page counts", the last remnant of a section that once compared three
# corpora (Ben, 2026-07-28).  Its final paragraph told the reader that MAM is a consensus text
# rather than a diplomatic one and is not one of Breuer's editions -- true, and every word of it
# an answer to something that happened in the drafting rather than to anything on the page.  Ben:
# "I had to explain all that to you because you kept saying wacky stuff about MAM being a Breuer
# edition, and initially framing this whole page against WLC, but that's dirty laundry/internal
# history the reader doesn't need to know about.  Elsewhere it is clear that MAM is the
# reference."  The rule it stands for: a paragraph that exists because a discussion went a
# certain way is internal history, not page text, however accurate it is.  The corpus is named
# where the counts are, which is where a reader meets it.


# The three rows Breuer's CoS ch. 9 §37 licenses on a compound: the metigah in the chanted word
# of a small zaqef, and the mayela in that of an etnaxta or of a silluq.  Those are the two marks
# his §37 names -- the only ones of the 21 books, he says, that a maqaf stands after -- and the
# table has each of them under whichever mafsik it serves, so the rule reaches three rows and not
# two.  Keyed by the survey's shape shorthand, so a pair that stopped occurring would drop out
# of the sum silently; ``pin_claims`` is what stops that.

        #     reason the mark is there.
        #   * "landed short of its last atom" pictured a mark that missed.  A secondary accent
        #     has its own position, in front of the main accent; nothing aimed at the last atom
        #     and fell short.  Transformative framing of exactly the banned kind.
        #   * It asserted of all 233 what holds of the 230 routed ones; the three undecided are
        #     undecided precisely because this cannot be checked for them.
        # What replaces it is the point MAQAF_IS_THE_LAST_RUNG stands for: these marks are not a

        # JUST THE PAIRS THAT OCCUR (Ben, 2026-07-28).  The table used to be Yeivin's closed
        # list, with each case placed in one of his categories, plus two rows for the cases the

    that reasoning goes on the page -- he said so in the same breath -- so it lives here, and
    the page carries the assertion alone, attributed to MAM rather than left agentless.

    THE TYPE COLUMN is the one thing here that groups: it puts those two rows together, geresh
    and gershayim being one thing for this purpose, and it separates out Ezekiel 20:31, whose
    mahapakh with a qadma is on no list.  See ``_ONE_LETTER_TYPE_GERSTAR_TG`` and its
    neighbours.  The rows are sorted by it, so the five stand together and the odd one last.

    "WORD", NOT "CHANTED WORD", IS RIGHT IN THIS HEADING, and is not the loose "word" #81 bans.
    Ben, 2026-07-29: it "can just say 'word' since there are no compounds so by any/either
    definition of 'word', these are words".  Not one of the six is a maqaf compound, so atom and
    chanted word name the same six things and the reader has nothing to disambiguate.

    AND THE RULE IS WIDER THAN THAT, lest a later pass read this heading as licensed only by the
    absence of compounds.  Ben, same day, correcting a first version of this paragraph that said
    so: "even a column having only compound words, or simple and compound words, might still be
    labelled word since what definition of 'word' is active is clear from the contents of the
    column!  Also in many contexts it is unnecessary to qualify a word as chanted because it is
    clear from context."  So a column of compounds may say "word" too -- the forms in it show
    which sense is meant, and a heading is read with its column, not alone.  What #81 bans is a
    loose "word" the reader must resolve from nothing; the qualifier is owed where the sense is
    genuinely in doubt, and is noise where the context settles it.  The hover text here says
    "chanted word" anyway, which costs nothing.
