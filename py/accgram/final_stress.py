r"""Is a chanted word stressed on its last syllable?

ONE QUESTION, NOT A PHONOLOGY LAYER.  Issue #48 wants syllabification, open-versus-closed
syllables and a short-versus-long vowel determination derived from the pointing, and it says
plainly: do not build that from scratch, reuse ``../al-hatorah/py/aht_phon``.  This module does not
build it.  It answers one question that needs none of what #48 is hard about -- no open/closed, no
short/long, no qamats gadol against qamats qatan: does the accent fall at or after the point where
the chanted word's LAST syllable begins?  An impositive accent is written on the stressed syllable,
so that question and "is this chanted word stressed on its last syllable" are the same question
asked of a text that already has accents on it.

Ben, 2026-07-31, stating the rule this module implements: "if there's only one vowel sound left in
the word, and a geresh is on it, we can assume that the word is finally stressed".

WHY NOT ``aht_phon`` ITSELF.  It cannot be imported here: a cross-repo import would need
``sys.path`` surgery, which this repo forbids outright, and al-hatorah is private besides.  What is
importable is its OUTPUT, which is #48's second path -- and that is what
``py/tests/test_final_stress_vs_phonetic_mam.py`` does, checking every verdict this module reaches
against Phonetic MAM's real stress model.  So the rule here is measured against the engine rather
than standing in for it.

NUCLEI, NOT SYLLABLES.  A syllable's boundaries are the hard part; its NUCLEUS is a point written
in the text.  So the rule finds the last nucleus, backs up to the consonant that carries it, and
asks whether the accent is at or after that consonant.  Nothing else about the chanted word is
looked at, and no syllable but the last one is ever located.  Four things decide what counts as a
nucleus:

* A full vowel or a xataf is one.  So is a SHURUQ -- a vav with a dagesh point, no vowel of its
  own, and no nucleus on the letter before it, which is what tells a shuruq from a doubled vav
  closing the syllable before it (the two vavs of ויצוו differ in exactly that).
* A SHEVA is not, and is ignored rather than judged vocal or silent.  Ignoring it cannot move the
  last nucleus: a vocal sheva is always followed by a full vowel, which is counted in its own
  right, and a silent one closes a syllable that already has its nucleus.  So the
  vocal-versus-silent question, which is real phonology, never arises.
* A FURTIVE PATAX is not: a patax written on the last base letter of an atom, that letter being
  xet, ayin or he, is pronounced before the guttural rather than after it and opens no syllable.
  Without this rule מזבח and רוח both come out penultimately stressed, and both are stressed on
  the last syllable they have.
* A MATER LECTIONIS needs no rule of its own, because nuclei are read off POINTS and not off
  letters: an unpointed alef, he, vav or yod simply has none.

BACKING UP TO THE ONSET is the one place a syllable, rather than a nucleus, has to be located, and
it is needed at both ends.  A xolam male or a shuruq writes the vowel on a VAV that is a mater, so
the nucleus of שלום sits one letter after the consonant whose syllable it is -- and the accent is
on that consonant.  Pulling the other way, an accent is sometimes written on a mater AFTER the
vowel it belongs with: WLC has the ole of לא־היה on the final he, a letter with no point on it at
all.  Asking whether the accent is at or after the last syllable's ONSET reads both cases right,
where asking about the nucleus itself misreads one or the other.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO.  It says nothing about which syllable is stressed when the mark that would
tell is written at the chanted word's edge instead: ``NOT_IMPOSITIVE`` is the list of those, and
``maqaf_nonfinal_accents.stress_mark_letter`` gives this module no letter for a chanted word whose
last mark is one of them.  A postpositive accent's stress helper does carry the information, and it
is left alone -- reading a helper would mean deciding which of two same-codepoint copies is the
helper, which is the survey's business rather than this module's.
