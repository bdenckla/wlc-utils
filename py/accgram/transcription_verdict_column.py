r"""The grammaticality column both satellite verdict tables carry (issue #52).

``printed_decalogue_simanim_page`` and ``printed_decalogue_koren_page`` each render a
per-Decalogue verdict table saying how far a printed Decalogue follows the Wikisource strand it
was diffed against (issue #69).  That is a token-IDENTITY claim.  This module supplies those
tables' last column, which asks the different question this repo's printed-Decalogue work started
from: fed through accgram's prose checker, is what the page prints GRAMMATICAL -- and is it as
grammatical as the Wikisource strand it follows?  ``transcription_parse`` computes the verdicts;
here they become a table cell.

WHY THE COLUMN IS AGAINST THE WIKISOURCE STRAND AND NOT ABSOLUTE.  Four of the twelve transcribed
Decalogues follow the p-trad עליון, whose opening chanted verse merges the first two
commandments and is ungrammatical -- the companion page's headline finding.  Those four print
that verse, so each is "ungrammatical somewhere" while departing from its Wikisource strand
nowhere.  A
column that only counted failures would put them beside the one page that really does depart,
and the two facts are not the same fact.

SHARED, SO IT CANNOT DRIFT.  The two pages must say this identically -- the same reason
``printed_decalogue_strands`` single-sources ``MOST_STRIKING`` and the Shabbat signal-word
shorthand -- and the cell is derived from the checker's own result rather than written out per
row, so no row can claim a verdict the checker does not give.  Each page keeps its own table:
the other four columns are that page's material.

WHAT A REJECTION SAYS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.  It says the chanted verse is ungrammatical, and
the pages say that without qualification: it is a fact about the accent sequence, not an
artifact of this checker, and one an internal study of the edition would reach on its own, since
the rest of that edition's accentuation is grammatical.  It does NOT say the edition is in
error, or that the passage should not be chanted as printed; the pages must not say either.  A
clean rate is not the objective (issue #52).
