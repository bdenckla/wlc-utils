r"""Generate gh-pages/accgram/printed-decalogue-uvinkha.html -- the editions cited at ובנך.

A record page, not an argument page.  MAM-basics issue #208 asks whether Hebrew Wikisource's
p-trad עליון is right to have a meteg and a maqaf on ובנך in the Exodus Decalogue's Shabbat
commandment, where Koren's Classic Tanakh and the Simanim Tiqqun each have a munax instead --
the two editions transcribed for issue #69, whose verdicts the trio's satellite pages carry.
A reply in that thread answers it by citing eight printed editions plus Minxat Shai, each by an
archive.org or Al-Hatorah link.  This page holds those links, with a crop of each cited page, so
a reader can check a citation without opening nine scans.

The argument stays in the issue and is deliberately NOT reproduced here.  The page shows the two
pointings in letters, accents and the punctuation coupled to them (the LAP table, whose whole
derivation is pinned -- see the comment above ``_STRETCH_SKELETONS``), says in one paragraph what
each has, asks the question, and then does nothing but cite and show.  Captions are short by
design -- name the edition and say what part of the page the crop is, and let the reader look.
Do not grow them into readings of the marks; the crops are low-resolution and the issue is where
a reading belongs.

Every cited edition has a crop as of 2026-07-27.  An edition with none renders "No crop recorded
yet" rather than being silently omitted; to add one, drop the PNG in gh-pages/accgram/img/ under
the same ``<Edition>-Ex-Dec-Shabbat-uvinkha`` naming and add a ``_Crop`` to that edition's tuple.

No edition is identified by chapter and verse (Ben, 2026-07-27): the page had got that far
without one, and the Decalogue's verse numbering varies by edition, so a number picked from any
one of them would not locate the place in the others.

# the repo to quote.  It is assembled only from vendored atoms: the p-trad עליון's own אתה and
# ובתך (which both transcriptions match) and the p-trad תחתון's own ובנך, which is the very
# thing the transcriptions record -- a munax on ובנך standing as its own chanted word.  Every
# step is pinned in _pinned_lap_rows, which raises rather than render a row it cannot justify.
#
# Meteg is kept in the strip (METEG_ALL) although it is not an accent: it is the mark at issue
# on one side of the disagreement, and a strip that dropped it would hide the thing to look at.
