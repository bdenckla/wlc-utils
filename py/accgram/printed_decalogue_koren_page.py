r"""Generate gh-pages/accgram/printed-decalogue-koren.html -- does the Koren Tanakh follow the
printed or the manuscript Decalogue tradition?  Answer: the printed tradition.

Companion to ``printed_decalogue_simanim_page``: the same question, asked of Koren instead of
Simanim's Tiqqun.  The four cantillation strands of the opening אנכי…מצותי span are derived live
from the vendored ``in/accgram/printed_decalogue_teamim.json`` by the shared
``printed_decalogue_strands`` module and tabulated on the ``printed-decalogue`` companion page;
this page links to that table rather than duplicating it, and serves only to document Koren's
place in the p-trad camp -- plus one Koren note that shows the same editorial self-awareness the
Simanim page found in SimTiq.

What establishes the answer is Koren's *body text*: its Exodus main Decalogue (pp. 113-114) is the
p-trad תחתון and its appendix Decalogue (p. A38) the p-trad עליון, and both are compared, by
the author, against what Hebrew Wikisource records as the printed tradition, and they match.  That
body text is asserted here, not transcribed word-for-word (only shown as scans).

Since issue #69 the claim rests on more than a spot-check: all FOUR Koren Decalogues have a
committed hand transcription of every printed accent (``in/accgram/edition_transcriptions/
koren_*.txt``), diffed against the vendored strand and pinned by
``tests/test_edition_transcriptions.py``.  TWO of the four match their Wikisource strand mark
for mark; the other two -- both appendix ones -- differ from it only at the maqaf, the Exodus
one splitting two compounds that strand joins and the Deuteronomy one joining one it leaves
apart.  A maqaf difference is an ordinary difference at the bottom of the trio's one scale,
stated to the reader
via ``printed_decalogue_strands.MAQAF_IS_THE_LAST_RUNG``; a 2026-07-25 claim audit found this page
using "every accent" two ways at once (see the guardrail comments below), so every verdict here
names the first rung that breaks rather than claiming a bare "every accent".  ``_verdict_table``
renders the four, one row per Decalogue -- never one per edition, since the four verdicts differ.

The one *note* is the secondary, more-for-fun material -- kept for how aware Koren is of the older,
printed-tradition choice it makes:

  * **appendix p. A38** (עליון): a note on the merged עליון Decalogue, citing רוו״ה
    (= ר' וולף היידנהיים, R. Wolf Heidenheim), directing that the First Commandment -- through
    מבית עבדים -- be read בטעם התחתון, i.e. as its own chanted verse rather than merged into the
    long opening verse the עליון body prints.  This is the exact mirror of SimTiq's p. 83
    side-margin note: the עליון body ends אנכי…עבדים on a revia, and the note flags the
    standalone-verse (ten-commandment) alternative it declines to print.

The verdict table's LAST column is issue #52's question asked of these four: run through accgram's
prose checker, is Koren's accentuation grammatical, and as grammatical as the Wikisource strand
it follows?  All four give their Wikisource strand's verdicts exactly, which for the two
APPENDIX (עליון) Decalogues means printing the p-trad עליון's merged opening chanted verse --
the one the checker rejects.  So the
p. A38 note above happens to name the alternative the checker's objection points at: read the
First Commandment in the תחתון and the merged verse never arises.  The note argues from the count
of ten commandments and says nothing about grammar, so the conclusion states that as a coincidence
of subject and credits Koren with no grammatical motive.  The cells come live from
``transcription_verdict_column``, shared with the Simanim page so the two cannot drift.

Editorial / style conventions are shared with the two companion pages and documented on
``printed_decalogue_strands`` (bare-Hebrew strand names תחתון / עליון -- never transliterated or
translated; the single-sourced ``ROM_*`` accent romanizations; the real-em-dash rule).  The thin
``_TAHTON`` / ``_ELYON`` aliases below just limit prose churn; the ``_ROM_*`` ones additionally
wrap each name in the italic ``span.romanized``, so they are HTML nodes rather than strings (see
the comment at that alias block).  As on the Simanim
page: prefer "cantillation" to "accentuation"; keep romanized names ("taḥton") in image ``alt``
text on purpose (attribute contexts are exempt from the Hebrew-letter rule by design -- see the
"Attribute contexts are EXEMPT" bullet in ``printed_decalogue_strands``); and keep the two term
pairs strictly apart.  *main* vs *appendix* = the book's two parts (the running Torah text vs the
Decalogue reprinted in the appendix) -- use "main" ONLY for that pair, worded as "main Decalogue" /
"appendix Decalogue", never "main text"; and *body* (printed text) vs *note* (annotation).  Do not
regress "main" to "running text" here: the Simanim page's docstring is the fuller statement of this
rule.  (Note Koren is a **Tanakh**, not a ḥumash -- the Simanim page glosses this same pair as "the
running ḥumash", which is right for its Torah-only Tiqqun but would be wrong here.)

DRAFT-STAGE FACTS TO VERIFY (issue #70, which collects everything awaiting the physical book):
the appendix page numbers (A38 / A39) come from the committed scan filenames, as does the fact
that the page never says where the appendix physically sits; and רוו״ה is *tentatively* expanded
to Wolf Heidenheim (likely but unconfirmed, flagged as such in the rendered notation line).
The Exodus main Decalogue's extent is NO LONGER draft-stage: transcribing it settled that it runs
pp. 113-114, p. 113 breaking mid-20:12, so every prose citation reads "pp. 113-114".  (The p. 113
figure caption stays a bare "p. 113" on purpose -- it captions a scan of the Decalogue's start,
which really is on p. 113.)

Two readings on these pages were flagged uncertain during transcription and are pinned in
``_UNCERTAIN_READINGS``: p. 114's לא of לא תרצח and p. 281's tipexa on את־שמו.  Neither appears on
the rendered page in any form -- Ben's call, 2026-07-24 (issue #69 decision 8): both are bounded to
discriminate nothing this page claims, neither can move a verdict, their reader-facing home is
issue #70, and the page assumes them true.  Don't add a hedge or a footnote for them.

The appendix's separate pagination IS now confirmed (Ben, 2026-07-15), which is why every citation
of it reads "p. A38", never a bare "p. 38": the appendix restarts its own page numbering at 1, so
an unprefixed 38 would read as page 38 of the book's main part and, being lower than the main
Decalogue's own p. 113, would wrongly suggest the appendix sits *before* it.  Keep the A prefix on
appendix citations, and don't "normalize" it away.  (The scan *filenames* keep their original
``Koren-appendix-p-38-...`` spelling -- they are committed assets, and "appendix" already
disambiguates them.)

Koren's Deuteronomy (Vaetxanan) Decalogue *has* now been spot-checked (issue #66), so the claim is
no longer Exodus-scoped: Koren has the p-trad in both books.  The Deuteronomy check also reaches
a second divergence point the Exodus scans cannot -- the Shabbat commandment -- where Koren again
has the p-trad, and where Simanim's Tiqqun does not (an accents-only departure: Simanim's Tiqqun
still follows the p-trad's chanted verse boundaries).  See the conclusion's scope note.

Its Deuteronomy עליון is no longer unchased either.  The page long carried a sentence saying the
Deuteronomy half of the claim rested on the תחתון alone because that appendix Decalogue had never
been checked; ``koren_dt_elyon`` (p. A39) transcribes it, with zero divergences, so the sentence
was false and is gone.  Don't reinstate it.

Regenerate with ``main_accgram.py generate-html``; test with
``tests/test_printed_decalogue_koren.py`` (plus the tree-wide ``tests/test_transliterations.py``).

# The per-Decalogue verdict table (issue #69)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# One row per Decalogue, never one per edition -- the rule the Simanim page's own table follows,
# and for the same reason: how far a Decalogue follows its Wikisource strand differs between the
# four, so a single per-edition verdict would have to be either false or vacuous. The class turns
# OFF the shared odd-row zebra as its sibling printed-Decalogue tables do (issue #65, finding
# C3): the rows alternate main / appendix, so the stripe would tint exactly the two appendix rows
# and read as if it encoded that.
#
# The two readings flagged uncertain during transcription (p. 114's לא of לא תרצח, p. 281's tipexa
# on את־שמו) are deliberately NOT mentioned here or anywhere on this page -- Ben's call,
# 2026-07-24. Both are bounded to discriminate nothing this page claims, neither can move a
# verdict, and their reader-facing home is issue #70; the page assumes both readings true and
# states its verdicts flat. Don't reintroduce them as a hedge or a footnote.
#
# The last column (issue #52) is the grammaticality verdict, and it is NOT written out per row:
# each cell comes from the checker's own result for the transcription the row names, so the column
# cannot claim a verdict the checker does not give. Its prose is shared with the Simanim page's
# table -- see transcription_verdict_column.
#
# GUARDRAIL on the "how far it follows it" column (2026-07-25 claim audit, finding 3). Two rows
# said more than they had. The Deuteronomy appendix row claimed "Every accent, with no difference
# anywhere" although that page JOINS לא־תעשה into a maqaf compound where ws/dt/elyon/printed sets
# the two atoms apart -- token-invisible (the streams are identical with the maqaf dropped) but a
# real difference, so "no difference anywhere" was false and only "no ACCENT difference" is true.
# And the Deuteronomy main row's "five independent ways" was a count with no stated criterion,
# unreconcilable with the hub's "three" and the test suite's "eight" for the same divergence set.
# Both are fixed by the same two moves, which any rewrite must keep: scope every "no difference"
# to accents, and take the divergence-set counts from printed_decalogue_taxton_diff rather than
# typing them (``counts`` below is derived and raises on drift).
#
# THE ONE VOWEL, and why the two rows may state it (2026-07-25). The twelfth Deuteronomy site and
# the fifth Exodus one are the same chanted word and are not accent differences at all: the m-trad has
# qamats in תִרְצָ֖ח where the p-trad has patax, on the same tipexa. A transcription of accents
# cannot carry that, so until now the Deuteronomy row hedged it as "the last one of vowels alone"
# and claimed nothing about which vowel Koren has -- nobody had looked. Both were then read off
# the committed page scans, and both are patax, the p-trad vowel:
#   * Deuteronomy, A5-D-281.jpg p. 281 printed line 12 (the line the .txt gives as "silsof mer tip
#     mun", לך׃ לא תרצח ולא);
#   * Exodus, A2-E-114.jpg p. 114 printed line 1.
# The reading is decidable rather than a judgement call because this type distinguishes the two
# unmistakably and both controls sit on the same page: its qamats is a bar with a blob attached
# below the bar's centre (p. 281 line 11, the final kaf of אלהיך), its patax a bare bar (the same
# line's xataf patax under the alef of אשר). Under the tsadi of תרצח there is a bare bar plus,
# lower and to its left, the detached hook this type uses for tipexa -- the same hook that sits
# under the he of that line's own אלהיך. No blob: patax.
# This is a primary observation about the physical edition and it is NOT in the transcription
# apparatus, which by design records accents only. Its home is the note in each transcription's
# .txt comment block (the same place the pasoleg_kinds observation lives). Do not restate it as a
# fact the diff establishes, and do not expect a test to defend it.
