"""Build a per-line transcription editor for a page of a book scan.

Usage:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_edition_transcription.py editor <book-dir> <name> \
        [--crop L T R B] [--width N] [--name STEM] [--debug]

Writes .novc/scans/<stem>-editor.html: the page image with a text field that sits directly
under whichever line is being transcribed, on top of the image.  The field follows the
current line down the page, so the eye never leaves the line it is reading -- the ergonomic
problem with transcribing a whole page in one go.  It covers the NEXT line while it is open,
which costs nothing, since that line is not the one being read.  --debug additionally writes
<stem>-lines.png with the detected line bands drawn on the page, to check the segmentation
before typing into it.

Line finding is a horizontal projection profile, not OCR: the fraction of each pixel row that
is ink, smoothed; rows above a threshold are text and the troughs between them are the gaps.
Nothing here reads a letter or an accent -- it only finds where the lines are.  Binarizing and
then resizing the column to one pixel wide with a BOX filter gives that per-row ink fraction
directly, which is why this needs no numpy.

The projection is taken over the CROPPED region, so crop to a single text column first: a
two-column page profiled whole has no clean troughs, since the columns' lines do not align.

--crop's LEFT and RIGHT bound the text column, as before.  Its TOP and BOTTOM name the LINES
TO TRANSCRIBE, not the region to run band detection over.  When they crop into the page (are
not the full 0..1 height), detection runs over a region grown about a line past them each way,
and only bands whose centre falls within the requested range get a field to type into; the
neighbours are rendered too, dimmed as context, since a Hebrew line's own above-marks are what
tell it apart from the line above's below-marks.  So the crop is set to just the wanted lines,
and the old "reach the middle of the neighbouring line" dead zone -- a bound between the two
good placements that clipped a line or let ``_absorb_slivers`` swallow a sliver of the next --
is unreachable, because the region detected over is no longer the reader's to choose.  See
issue #71.

THAT SPLIT IS ALSO AN EXPORT-FORMAT CHANGE, and the two shapes are distinguished by presence
alone: ``render.crop`` used to mean the region rendered and now means the lines requested,
with ``render.detect_crop`` -- written only when the crop grew -- holding the region.  Every
transcription committed before #71 is of the older shape and was deliberately left alone --
today that is ALL of them, so the first export with a ``detect_crop`` will be the first reader
of one, and there will be no re-vendoring to flush the old shape out.  ``rendered_region`` is the
one place that rule is written down as code; read an export through it rather than reaching
for ``render["crop"]``, which answers the old question for old exports and the new one for new.

    Both failures below are SILENT otherwise: the debug overlay draws a plausible band either

    A Hebrew crop should reach the MIDDLE of the neighbouring printed line, not stop tight at
    the transcribed text -- Hebrew stacks marks above AND below the letters, and a half-line's
    own above-marks are what let them be told apart from the last full line's below-marks.
    That leaves two ways to get the vertical bound wrong, and they pull in opposite directions:

    * Too tight, and the outermost line is clipped.  Koren p. 281's first crop cut the bottom
      four source pixels off line 17, taking part of the under-letter marks with it -- and
      tipexa, merkha and munax all sit under the letter.
    * Not tight enough to clear the next line, but not far enough to include it either.  A
      clipped sliver is shorter than SLIVER_FRACTION of a line, so ``_absorb_slivers`` folds
      it into the last real band, which is right for a fragment shaved off by a split and
      wrong for a genuine neighbour cut by the crop.  On that same page, bottoms of 0.610 and
      0.614 gave the last band a height of 208 and 232 px against a true 127.

    So: clear the next line entirely, or take half of it, and never a sliver.

    LEVELS, and why they differ.  A merged band is unambiguously wrong, so it warns.  A band
    touching the crop edge is NOT: on a correct crop the outermost band IS the half-line of
    context the rule asks for, and it necessarily touches the edge.  Nothing in the geometry
    separates that from a transcribed line cut short -- both are simply short -- so it is a
    note that states both readings rather than a warning that would fire on every correct crop
