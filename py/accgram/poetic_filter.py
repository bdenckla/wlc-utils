"""Genre filter for the poetic (Three Books) accent grammar.

The inverse of accgram.prose_filter: where the prose filter *excludes* every verse
that uses poetic cantillation so it never reaches the prose parser, this filter
*keeps* exactly those verses and drops everything else.  The poetic corpus is
Psalms and Proverbs wholesale plus the poetically-cantillated verses of Job (Job's
prose frame -- 1:1-3:1, 42:7-17, and a few scattered lines -- uses the prose
system and is handled by the prose grammar instead).

``is_poetcant`` is reused exactly as prose_filter uses it, so the two filters
agree verse-for-verse on the prose/poetic boundary in Job; the BHS-coordinate
hard exclusions prose_filter carries (the Decalogue ranges, Gn 35:22) are prose
verses outside ps/pr/Job and so are simply never kept here.
