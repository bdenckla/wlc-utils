        # the scanner swallows, which is why MAM's elyon parses cleanly.) The checker supplies
        # the taḥton's qadma (clean, on the supplied-marks page) and emits WLC's actual
        # merkha in the elyon, so only the elyon is a dt 5:8 oddity now. UXLC corrects
        # the merkha to a meteg but supplies a pashta rather than the due qadma; see the
        # linked UXLC note page (its `-t` te'amim note). UXLC has since proposed a pending
        # change (for UXLC 2.6) to change that pashta to the qadma -- exactly the
        # correction this note argues for. Whether the error originates in LC, BHS, or BHQ
