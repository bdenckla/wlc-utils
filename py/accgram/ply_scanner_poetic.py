r"""Hand-written scanner for the POETIC (Three Books) accent system.

The poetic counterpart of accgram.ply_scanner.  Where the prose scanner ports
tnk2acc.l's GG-state table verbatim, there is no poetic flex source, so the rule
table here is built from the *poetic* (Tabula Accentuum column II) readings of the
accents, as tabulated in ``in/wlc420/supplmt.wts`` and cross-checked
against decoded L verses.  The rule table matches over the Unicode mark alphabet
(``accent_marks``, the ``am.*`` patterns below); each accent is its own codepoint.

accent -> poetic reading (the accents that matter in the Three Books):

  disjunctives
    sof pasuq
    silluq        a meteg/silluq immediately before sof pasuq              II.1
    atnaḥ                                                                  II.3
    oleh-we-yored ole sign (above, pre-stress) plus the yored = merkha     II.2
                  below the stress; the merkha is consumed into the one
                  OLEH_WEYORED token, not emitted as a servus
    revia mugrash geresh muqdam (preposed) plus revia; if the revia dot    II.5
                  is omitted because it would fall on the same letter as
                  the geresh muqdam, it is implied
    revia         gadol or qatan -- same sign; disambiguated in a second   II.4=8
                  pass: a revia whose next disjunctive is oleh-we-yored
                  is qatan, otherwise gadol
    deḥi                                                                   II.9
    tsinnor       (no zarqa exists in the poetic system)                   II.7
    pazer                                                                  II.10
    shalshelet gedolah  shalshelet sign + paseq                           II.6
    legarmeh      azla legarmeh / mahapakh legarmeh, i.e. a conjunctive    II.12
                  (azla or mahapakh) followed by paseq, as prose munaḥ+paseq

  conjunctive servi
    munaḥ   merkha   mahapakh   azla   illuy   tarḥa
    galgal (yeraḥ; also the servus of oleh-we-yored and of pazer)

  fused / emitted (Plan C -- stop swallowing real accents)
    tsinnorit     fused onto its mahapakh / merkha partner in the same
                  chanted word -> one MAHAPAKH_METSUNNAR / MERKHA_METSUNNAR conjunctive
    shalshelet qetannah  bare shalshelet (no following paseq) -> emitted as a servus
    two adjacent accents on one letter that are not a WHITELISTED pair (revia+geresh
                  muqdam, ole+yored, deḥi+munaḥ) -> one order-less a!b bang-pair (e.g.
                  merkha + azla -> merkha!azla); faithfully emitted but NOT a grammar
                  token (a non-whitelisted same-letter stack is a lexical anomaly ->
                  NO_PARSE)

  swallowed (secondary / ga`ya / separators, not structural accents)
    meteg (not before sof pasuq)   narrow-sense paseq   upper/lower puncta

  fail-fast (Plan C): any other stray accent (U+0591..U+05AE) no rule consumes is
  emitted as STRAY_ACCENT (the grammar has no terminal for it -> NO_PARSE), never
  silently swallowed.  Zero live customers (the lone ps124:4 geresh is consumed by the
  same-letter revia mugrash charity).

Note: "revia mugrash without geresh" (#367 = Breuer Ch 10 §17-18) -- a bare revia
acting as the main verse divider when the verse has no atnaḥ -- is NOT a gap: it is
the last disjunctive before silluq, so _reclassify_revia maps it to REVIA_MUGRASH
(see that function's docstring), and the rich revia_mugrash_clause then carries its
viceroys (deḥi etc.), parsing Breuer's revia-substitute-for-atnaḥ verses (Ps
105:45, 119:4, Job 14:4) without verse-level context.

Known gaps (deferred to the validation pass, see the module's tests / notes):
  - oleh-we-yored whose ole is unmarked (only the yored merkha is written -- #363):
    recovered when the galgal servus immediately precedes it (see
    _recover_unmarked_oleh, MAM-cross-checked); the rarer "when a revia precedes"
    variant is still read as a servus (its signal is ambiguous -- see that helper).

The scanner returns a list of (token_type, leaf_name) pairs ready for
accgram.ply_grammar_poetic.parse_tokens; the verse begins with ('TILDE','') and
ends with ('SOFPASUQ', 'sof pasuq').
