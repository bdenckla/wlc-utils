"""Bring up a page of a book scan, downscaled to something readable.

Usage:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_edition_transcription.py scan-page <book-dir> \
        <name> [<name> ...] [--width N] [--crop L T R B] [--name STEM]

<name> is a scan filename with or without the .jpg (e.g. C085, A2-E-113, V-038).  Output is
written to .novc/scans/ -- gitignored, since a rendering is disposable and can be regenerated
from the scan, but stable across sessions unlike a temp directory.

The scans themselves are a personal archive outside the repo (see WLC_SCANS_DIR).  Filename
conventions differ per book: the Simanim Tiqqun's main body is an identity map from printed
page to C<page:03d>.jpg, while the Koren Classic Tanakh numbers the Torah continuously as
A<n>-<letter>-<page:03d>.jpg and gives its appendix a separate V-<page:03d>.jpg sequence.

This only WRITES the PNG.  To put one in front of the reader, hand over a ``file:///`` link
to it -- absolute path, forward slashes, three slashes after ``file:`` -- and open NOTHING:
no Start-Process, no browser pane, no desktop viewer.  The reader often has the page open
already, so a launched copy is a duplicate window (house rule, 2026-07-28).  To verify the
output yourself, Read the PNG rather than opening it anywhere.

The raw scans are ~5100x7100 and 4-13 MB, too big to open comfortably or to hand to the Read
tool, which is the whole reason this exists.

--crop takes four fractions of the page in 0..1, left top right bottom, applied before the
resize -- so cropping to a quarter of the page and keeping --width the same doubles the
effective resolution.  That is what makes a conjunctive legible: a whole Tiqqun page at 1400px
shows the disjunctive skeleton and the maqafs, but merkha vs. meteg needs the zoom.
Right-hand (accented) column of a SimTiq two-column page is roughly --crop 0.5 0 1 1.

--name sets the output stem, so successive crops of one page do not overwrite each other
(a crop otherwise lands on <name>-crop.png regardless of which region it is).  It names ONE
stem, so it refuses to run with more than one page: every page would land on the same file,
the last one silently winning.

The SCANS/OUT constants here are also ``transcription_editor``'s, which imports them from
here: the two tools read the same archive and write to the same scratch directory.

``render_page`` is the one-page unit behind the subcommand, and is what ``zoom_line`` calls to
render its crops -- a function call, where it once ran this file as a subprocess by path.
