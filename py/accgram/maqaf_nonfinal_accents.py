r"""Survey: accents on the NON-FINAL atom of a maqaf compound, across the whole Tanakh.

An accent on a non-final atom of a maqaf compound is the phenomenon behind ``koren_dt_elyon``'s
``mun-mun`` on לא־תעשה and SimTiq's two munax-on-לא (see ``edition_transcription``).  This module
measures it mechanically so the printed-Decalogue pages' claims about how rare it is rest on a
count that can be regenerated, rather than on prose that has to be re-derived every time someone
asks.

Pure computation and a JSON writer -- no HTML.  ``maqaf_nonfinal_accents_page`` renders it, and
runs this to write the JSON, so the page's numbers can never drift from the data.

THE CRITERION is mechanical: within one whitespace-delimited chanted word, is there an accent both
before and after a maqaf?  A maqaf compound has no space in it, so splitting on whitespace really
does give chanted words, and splitting those on maqaf gives their atoms -- the two units this
module counts, and the two the question is about.  A U+05BD counts as an accent only on the
verse's last chanted word, where it is silluq (see CLAUDE.md on meteg-vs-silluq).  Read off the
Unicode verses and NOT off ``uni_to_marks``' mark bodies: ``word_to_marks`` front-loads prepositive
accents to the front of the whole COMPOUND, which would move an atom-2 telisha gedolah onto atom 1
and manufacture hits.
Prose and poetic are routed by ``prose_filter`` / ``poetic_filter`` and counted separately, since
the two systems differ here and a merged count would say nothing about either.

THE TWO ROUTES.  A single bucket of "compounds with two accents" hides the distinction that
matters, so every hit is sorted into one of two routes:

* **(a) A secondary accent the compound inherits.**  Yeivin's own term, and his prose inventory
  is a CLOSED LIST of configurations -- which accent sits on the non-final atom and which the
  compound has: metigah-zaqef (ITM §224), munax-zaqef (§221), a secondary merkha in the chanted word of a
  tipexa (§233) or of a tevir (§253), a secondary azla in that of a geresh (§268), a secondary
  munax in that of an etnaxta (§215), a revia (§236) or a pazer (§276), a secondary mahapakh in
  that of a pashta (§241), and the mayela before an etnaxta (§216) or a silluq (§210).  ("The
  mayela", never "the mayela tipexa": mayela is the name for what would otherwise be a tipexa
  there, so the pair reads as a kind of tipexa rather than as the accent's own name.  Mayela is
  to tipexa as metigah is to qadma, and nobody writes "metigah qadma".)
  ``_NAMED_CONFIGURATIONS`` is that list, plus one pair no section of his names --
  ``(MERKHA, SILLUQ)``, whose own label records that (issue #86).
  ``chanted_word_accents`` transcribes the same sections
  in full, with Yeivin's own wording and his closed verse lists, and checks them against a wider
  measurement that counts atomic chanted words too; the table here is the subset this survey's
  shape can express, which is a pair of marks with a maqaf between them.
* **(b) A maqaf written after an atom that keeps its own conjunctive.**  ITM §293: a manuscript
  habit with no grammatical trigger, "most common where the word has penultimate stress", and L
  -- WLC's own base -- is named for it (§21, §293).

POSITION IS EVIDENCE, NOT THE CRITERION.  Whether a non-final atom's accent sits where that atom's
own accent sits is answered exactly, with no phonology, by an in-corpus oracle: the same spelling
standing FREE elsewhere in the same corpus -- an atom that is a whole chanted word by itself, so
it has its own accent (``build_oracle``).  Key each atom by its letters and points with accents
stripped, and compare base letters after the accent.

* A **no** is decisive.  WLC's Nu 9:17 ואחרי־כן has its munax three letters from the end where
  the free ואחרי usually put theirs one from the end, so it cannot be that atom's own accent.
* A **yes is not decisive**, which is the trap.  A secondary accent can land on the atom's own
  stress anyway: MAM's שלף־חרב has its merkha where the free שלף usually have theirs, because
  nasog axor has retracted the stress before חרב, and it is still routed as a secondary merkha
  by its ``(MERKHA, SILLUQ)`` configuration.  So the CONFIGURATION decides the route and the
  oracle corroborates -- never the other way round.  Neither example states a figure here: the
  counts live in each occurrence's own ``oracle`` fields in the tracked JSON
  (``joined_letters_after_accent``, ``free_letters_after_accent``, ``free_occurrences``), and
  they regenerate with the survey.

Two refinements the oracle needs, both of which silently inverted verdicts before they were made:
the free side takes the LAST IMPOSITIVE accent, because a secondary accent always precedes the
main one and taking the first reads a restored secondary as the atom's own position; and
postpositive/prepositive accents are skipped entirely, since their position is a fact about the
chanted word's edge rather than about any atom's stress.

§293's further claim -- that the habit correlates with penultimate stress -- is NOT tested here.
That needs a real stress model; ``../al-hatorah/py/aht_phon/stress.py`` is the prior art.  Nothing
below changes that: ``final_stress`` answers one question about one syllable, and MAM has no
route-(b) hit for §293's claim to be tested on either way.

WHERE THE STRESS FALLS is a second measurement, and a narrow one.  The ``*_final_stress_by_pair``
fields say, of each pair whose accent written last is written on the stress, how many of its
chanted words are stressed on their last syllable.  ``final_stress`` is the rule, and its docstring
says why counting nuclei answers this without any of the phonology issue #48 is about.

WHAT THE SURVEY IS A SURVEY OF, which bounds every number it produces.  ``out/wlc422-kq-u`` is the
Westminster transcription of L.  ``in/UXLC-39`` is NOT a second manuscript -- its own header
records that it was produced from WLC 4.20 by WLC2XML -- so it is the same transcription plus
Kimball's corrections, and agreement between the two is not corroboration by a second hand.
MAM-simple is a CONSENSUS text rather than a diplomatic one -- no single manuscript's reading.
It largely follows Breuer, but it is not one of Breuer's own editions (Horev; and the Jerusalem
Crown, which he advised on).  There is therefore no second manuscript here at all: the
counts measure L as Westminster reads it, and what an edition does with it.  ``CORPUS_KIND``
records that so the page cannot state a corpus's standing wrongly.

THE GRAY MAQAF IS THE POETIC HALF OF THE ANSWER, and it is a second measure rather than more of
the first.  The scan above finds a compound by its WRITTEN maqaf, and in poetic verses the maqaf
after a secondary mark is customarily not written -- so the poetic count is a floor by
construction and no tightening of the scan can raise it.  MAM's own answer to that is the gray
maqaf (מקף אפור), its mark for a maqaf the manuscript leaves unwritten where the chanted word
needs one; ``gray_maqaf_survey`` counts it.  The doctrine is Breuer, Chapter 9 §§18-36, set out in
MAM's Wikisource introduction (authored at ``../MAM-basics/py/author_misc/
he_ws_intro_to_mam_gray_maqaf_*.mediawiki``), and the mark is preserved only in MAM-parsed-plus:
MAM-simple drops it, so this one count reads a different corpus from every other count here.
Two kinds are separated, because only one of them answers this page's question: an oleh with its
yored, and a tsinnorit with its partner, are ONE accent written across two atoms.

# TWO MARKS ARE NOT ALWAYS TWO ACCENTS, and on a SIMPLE chanted word the difference has to be
# made mechanically, this scan having no accent tokenization to lean on.  Two kinds of pair are
# set aside, each by a rule that reads the word rather than a list of references:
#
# * A stress-helper pair, where one accent is written twice under two codepoints.  Six accents
#   can need a stress helper, and for five of them the helper shares its accent's codepoint, so
#   a repeated mark never reaches here: that is one accent already, the same rule the compound
#   side applies.  The zarqa is the sole exception, and only because Unicode's two names are in
#   effect swapped -- U+0598 "HEBREW ACCENT ZARQA" is the HELPER and U+05AE "HEBREW ACCENT
#   ZINOR" is the zarqa.  So in a prose verse U+0598 before U+05AE is the zarqa written at the
#   chanted word's edge and again on the stressed syllable: one accent and its helper.  In a
#   POETIC verse the same two codepoints are the genuine and distinct tsinnorit and tsinnor,
#   which is why this rule is stated of prose -- and no poetic chanted word in any of the three
#   corpora carries the pair, so the exclusion has never had to decide a poetic case.
#   ``simple_exclusion`` asserts as much, so that stays true by construction rather than by
#   luck (item 15 of ``doc/review-findings-2026-07-29.md``).  See
#   ``_ZARQA_HELPER`` below for why ``accent_marks`` still spells them after the poetic sense.
# * Two marks on ONE LETTER.  Whatever such a pair is, it is not two accents on two syllables,
#   and the six in MAM's prose verses are of two kinds that a reader would want kept apart from
#   the rest either way -- five a geresh or gershayim with a telisha gedola, one (Ezekiel 20:31)
#   a mahapakh with a qadma.  MAM-basics' own sec-merk FOI profiles mark the same configuration,
#   with a ``+`` for two accents sharing a letter.
#
# The counts of each land in the survey, so a page can say what it leaves out and how much.

SIMPLE_EXCL_STRESS_HELPER = "a stress-helper pair: one accent written twice"

# ``accent_marks`` spells these two constants after the poetic sense, where the tsinnorit and
# the tsinnor are distinct accents; ``mb_cmn`` has the honest names, ZSH_OR_TSIT and Z_OR_TSOR.
# Renaming them in ``accent_marks`` would reach the poetic scanner and its tests, so it is left

    The fourth return is what a chanted word that is a LONE atom does with two accents, which
    the first three know nothing about: they are the compound survey, and a compound is what
    the maqaf makes.  A page saying two accents can appear on a chanted word whether it is
    compound or simple was making half that claim with nothing behind it (Ben, 2026-07-28: "it
    would be useful to know how many of these pairs appear on a compound chanted word, and how
    many appear on a simple chanted word"), so the same pass counts the simple ones.

    The fifth return is the two-accent compounds the hits criterion excludes: both accents on
    the FINAL atom, none on a non-final one.  The scan used to drop these silently, so the
    page could count the compounds that spread their two accents across two atoms but not the
    ones that concentrate both on the last atom (Ben, 2026-07-29, naming the two kinds
    "spreaders" and "concentrators").  Each record mirrors a simple one -- a lone final atom
    holds its two marks just as a simple chanted word does, so the same rules read them.

    A field of REPEATS is one accent written twice, not two accents -- the same rule the
    compound side applies -- so an atom counts here only when its accents are two DIFFERENT
    marks.  Order is the written order, which is the order the shapes are read in throughout.
    Two different marks are still not always two accents, so each simple and each concentrator
    record carries an ``excluded`` reason or ``None``; see ``SIMPLE_EXCL_ONE_LETTER`` above

    absent pair is one no mark answers for rather than one whose answer is zero -- and a pair
    that IS here has every one of its chanted words measured, the accent written last being the
    same accent throughout the pair.  Read a count against the pair's own entry in
    ``simple_by_pair`` or ``concentrator_by_pair``: equal counts mean every one of them is
    stressed on its last syllable.

    A pashta's or a telisha qetana's position is a fact about the chanted word's edge rather than
    about its stress, which is why those pairs are left out instead of counted at zero; see
    ``final_stress.NOT_IMPOSITIVE``.
