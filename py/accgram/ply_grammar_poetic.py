"""PLY yacc grammar for the POETIC (Three Books) accent system.

This is the poetic counterpart of accgram.ply_grammar (which ports acc2tre.y, the
prose / Twenty-One Books grammar).  There is no Goerwitz C oracle for the poetic
books; the productions here are derived from Yeivin, *Introduction to the Tiberian
Masorah* (ITM), the section "The Accents of the Three Books" (Psalms, Proverbs,
and the poetic core of Job), paragraphs 358-374.  Section numbers are cited
inline.  See also mb_cmn.hebrew_accents, whose poetic conjunctive list cites ITM
#358 / #361.

Breuer, *Ta'amei ha-Miqra*, Ch 10 (English trans. "Cantillation of Scripture,
Ch 10", the systematic theory of the Eme"t hierarchy: Emperor siluk -> Kings
[oleh-we-yored, ethnakhta, revia'] -> additional mafsiqim [revia mugrash, big
shalshelet, mahpakh legarmeih] -> Viceroys [big revia, tsinnor, small revia, dehi]
-> military secretaries [pazer, legarmeih]) is the parallel systematic source, and
confirms this same skeleton term-for-term: dehi as the final viceroy of
ethnakhta/revia only (never under oleh-we-yored); tsinnor and small revia only
under oleh-we-yored; and revia mugrash / big shalshelet as additional mafsiqim that
"can only divide the left side of ethnakhta" (the silluq-near second part) -- which
is exactly why a revia mugrash in atnah's own realm (Job 31:15, L-only) is rejected.
Ch 10 §9 on the doubled tsinnor is cited at collapse_repeated_tsinnor below.

Design: rank-ordered clause hierarchy, permissive servus chains.
  The *clause* rules encode Yeivin's disjunctive hierarchy by RANK: a domain headed
  by disjunctive D admits, as its near subdividers, the disjunctives of any lower
  rank -- not merely the one rank immediately below.  (Phase 3 relaxed an earlier
  "immediate-sub only" form: L freely uses a lower divider directly when a unit is
  too short for the intermediate one -- legarmeh straight under atnah, dehi or
  legarmeh straight before silluq -- exactly as the prose grammar's silluq/atnah
  domains admit their lower dividers.  Every such case here is MAM-confirmed.)  The
  *phrase* rules, by contrast, accept any run of conjunctive servi before a
  disjunctive, because Yeivin describes the poetic servi only loosely -- "up to N
  servi", "various combinations", "governed by intricate rules" -- and there is no
  oracle to pin exact patterns against.  So every ``D_phrase`` is just ``D``
  optionally preceded by a ``servi`` chain; the particular servus counts/orders
  Yeivin documents (munah/merka before silluq, galgal+mahpak/azla before pazer, the
  galgal "v"-servus of oleh-we-yored, etc.) are admitted but not required.

  Error recovery is limited to one rule (p_silluq_phrase_error): a verse missing
  its silluq entirely (category A) recovers into an ERROR-leaf silluq_phrase,
  mirroring the prose grammar.  p_error gates this to the verse-final-SOFPASUQ case
  so genuine mid-verse anomalies still surface as NO_PARSE (parse_tokens -> None).

Hierarchy of disjunctives (each lists its CANONICAL near subdivider(s); per the
rank-ordered design above, a domain also admits any lower-ranked divider directly
when a unit is too short for the intermediate one):

  silluq (verse end, #359)
    great division: oleh-we-yored (distant) OR atnah (close)             (#361)
    near division before silluq: revia mugrash / shalshelet gedolah  (#366, #371);
      also dehi / pazer / legarmeh directly when the final unit is short
  oleh-we-yored (the main verse divider, #363)
    main subdivider: revia gadol; immediately preceded by revia qatan
    (no servus) or tsinnor (with servus)                          (#363, #365, #368)
  atnah (#362)               -> dehi (near) / revia gadol (distant)  (#362, #364);
                                also pazer / legarmeh directly
  revia gadol (#363)         -> pazer / legarmeh; also dehi / tsinnor directly
  revia qatan (#368)         -> legarmeh; also tsinnor (TSINNOR REVIA_QATAN OLEH)
  revia mugrash (#366-367)   -> pazer / legarmeh (with geresh, tipeḥa-like);
                                also dehi / revia gadol when "without geresh" it
                                acts as the main verse divider like atnah (#367)
  dehi (#364)                -> pazer / legarmeh
  tsinnor (#365)              -> pazer / legarmeh
  pazer (#369)               -> legarmeh only
  legarmeh (#370)            -> (terminal lowest disjunctive)

Token disambiguation that the scanner (accgram.ply_scanner_poetic) performs and
this grammar relies on: the three revias share signs but are distinct tokens here
(REVIA_GADOL / REVIA_QATAN / REVIA_MUGRASH); the scanner separates them by the
geresh muqdam (mugrash) and by position (qatan only before oleh-we-yored, a bare
revia before silluq = mugrash without geresh, #391).

Grammar actions build trees with ply_tree.make_node / add_leaves, as the prose
grammar does, so accgram.ply_tree.print_tree renders poetic trees identically.

    n. 4) -- for grammaticality it counts once.  Collapsing the run lets the
    existing tsinnor productions parse it without a dedicated grammar rule the
    LALR(1) table cannot express (see the tsinnor-clause NOTE).

    Motivated by, and ONLY by, Ps 17:14.  That verse is the sole place in the
    Three Books where two tsinnor occur consecutively (of the 250 tsinnor-bearing
    poetic verses), so this rule fires on exactly one verse and exists only
    because of it.  It is phrased as a pattern (any consecutive-TSINNOR run)
    rather than a "ps 17:14" reference whitelist on principle -- a repeated
    divider counts once, wherever it occurs -- not because any other verse needs
    it; should the corpus ever change, this is the only verse it currently
    affects.

    Returns a new list with adjacent duplicate TSINNOR tokens dropped, or a list
    equal to the input when there is no such repeat.  This is a parse-only
    normalization: callers pass the canonical token list and must NOT let the
    result replace it, so the WLC-vs-MAM disjunctive cross-check keeps counting
    every tsinnor.
