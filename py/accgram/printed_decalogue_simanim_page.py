r"""Generate gh-pages/accgram/printed-decalogue-simanim.html -- does Simanim's Tiqqun follow
the printed or the manuscript Decalogue tradition?  Answer: the printed tradition (issue #62) --
precisely, it follows the p-trad's chanted verse boundaries, but not its every cantillation
detail: the Shabbat commandment of its Deuteronomy taḥton (appendix) Decalogue has the m-trad
accents, an accents-only divergence that moves no chanted verse boundary (see ``_conclusion``).

Companion to ``printed_decalogue_page`` (issue #52, which grammar-checks the printed vs
manuscript Decalogue accentuations and lays out the four cantillation strands).  This page ports
two research notes -- formerly issue #56 comments -- into a versioned, reviewable document:

  * **p. 83** (main Decalogue, *elyon*): Simanim's side-margin note on the Exodus (Yitro)
    Decalogue first span אנכי...עבדים.  Its default (בפנים) elyon reading ends that span on a
    *revia* (the merged, 9-verse printed structure); "some books" instead give אנכי...עבדים its
    own verse (silluq + *sof pasuq* at עבדים) to keep ten distinct commandments.
  * **p. 246** (appendix, *taḥton*): the mirror footnote, contrasting בטעם רגיל (= printed
    taḥton: אנכי...עבדים as its own verse, *sof pasuq* at עבדים) with כתר אר״ץ (= manuscript
    taḥton: pashta...etnaḥta, merged).

What actually establishes the answer is not these notes but Simanim's *body text*: its main
Decalogue (p. 83) and appendix Decalogue (p. 246) are compared, by the author, against what Hebrew
Wikisource records as the printed tradition, and they match.  That body text is asserted here,
not reproduced.  The two notes are secondary -- kept for the more-for-fun question of
how aware Simanim is of having made the older, printed-tradition choice.

Since issue #69 the finding rests on more than that comparison.  All EIGHT Decalogues on this page
-- the Tiqqun's four and the Simanim *Tanakh*'s four -- have a committed hand transcription of
every printed accent (``in/accgram/edition_transcriptions/simanim_*.txt``), diffed against the
vendored strand and pinned by ``tests/test_edition_transcriptions.py``.  ``_tiqqun_verdict_table``
and ``_tanakh_verdict_table`` render them, one row per Decalogue -- never one per edition, since
p. 247's Shabbat departure and pp. 208-209's exact agreement cannot share a sentence.

Each table's LAST column is issue #52's question asked of these eight: fed through accgram's
prose checker, is what the page prints grammatical, and as grammatical as the strand it follows?
The cells come live from ``transcription_verdict_column`` (shared with the Koren page) so no row
can claim a verdict the checker does not give.  Seven of the eight give their strand's verdicts
exactly.  p. 246 does not, and the prose after that table has to hold two true things together:
its divergences are all conjunctive, so its disjunctive skeleton is intact, AND one of its
chanted verses is ungrammatical where the strand is clean.  Frame that as a diagnostic of the
checker -- tuned to Tiberian-manuscript prose grammar -- never as an error in the edition.

TWO SENSES OF "TRANSCRIPTION", KEPT APART (issue #69 decision 3a).  This page had the word first
for the two *note* transcriptions -- the hand-set pointed Hebrew of the p. 83 and p. 246 notes,
double-checked against the committed scans, and still the only hand-set Hebrew in this module.
The accent transcriptions above are the other sense: a token per printed accent, machine-diffed,
and never displayed as Hebrew.  On first mention call those "hand transcriptions of the printed
accents"; where both senses appear in one section, the older one is "the note transcriptions".

The four cantillation strands of the opening אנכי...מצותי span are derived live from the vendored
``in/accgram/printed_decalogue_teamim.json`` by the shared ``printed_decalogue_strands`` module
and tabulated on the companion page; this page links to that table rather than duplicating it.

The trio frames that span around its two SIGNAL WORDS, עבדים and על־פני, whose accent pair
uniquely identifies which of the four strands a text has.  This page is where the limits of that
claim show: the pair identifies the four IDEALIZED Wikisource strands, and Simanim's Tiqqun is
not pure -- its Deuteronomy taḥton has the m-trad accents at the Shabbat commandment, an
accents-only departure the span pair cannot catch because it moves no chanted verse boundary.
Catching it requires GIVING the Shabbat commandment its own signal words
(``pds.SHABBAT_SIGNAL_SHORTHAND``,
where the complementary-jobs doctrine is spelled out).  So this page is the canonical example
keeping that second signal-word set load-bearing; never let a rewrite imply עבדים and על־פני
would have sufficed here.

Editorial / style conventions shared with the companion page -- bare-Hebrew strand names
תחתון / עליון (never transliterated or translated), the single-sourced ``ROM_*`` accent
romanizations, and the real-em-dash rule -- are documented on ``printed_decalogue_strands`` and
imported from it (the thin ``_TAHTON`` / ``_ELYON`` aliases below just limit prose churn; the
``_ROM_*`` ones additionally wrap each name in the italic ``span.romanized``, so they are HTML
nodes rather than strings -- see the comment at that alias block).  The conventions specific to
THIS page (keep them when editing):

* Prefer "**cantillation**" to "accentuation".
* **Three term pairs, kept strictly apart** (a recurring inconsistency -- don't regress):
  *main* vs *appendix* = the book's two parts (the running ḥumash vs the Decalogue reprinted at
  the back); *body* vs *note* = printed text vs annotation; and the two notes differ by
  placement.  Use "main" ONLY for main-vs-appendix -- pair it as "main Decalogue" /
  "appendix Decalogue", never "main text" -- and "body" ONLY for body-vs-note (so the p. 83
  note's ``בפנים`` renders as "the body", NOT "the main text").  The **p. 83** note sits in the
  **side margin** ("side-margin note"); the **p. 246** note sits in the **bottom margin**, keyed
  by an asterisk -- it is a **footnote**, so never call it a "marginal note".  For the pair, say
  "notes" (never "marginal notes").
* **Image ``alt`` text keeps romanized names** ("taḥton") on purpose -- attribute contexts are
  exempt from the Hebrew-letter rule by design; see the "Attribute contexts are EXEMPT" bullet in
  ``printed_decalogue_strands``' module docstring for the full rule and why.

Regenerate with ``main_accgram.py generate-html``; test with
``tests/test_printed_decalogue_simanim.py`` (plus the tree-wide
``tests/test_transliterations.py``).  The 2026-07-10 editorial pass that established the
conventions above kept a running edit log in gitignored scratch; every item was applied and the
durable rules were folded into this docstring, which is now their only home.

# signal words alone cannot reach.
#
# The class turns OFF the shared odd-row zebra, as its three sibling printed-Decalogue tables do
# (issue #65, finding C3): the four rows alternate main / appendix, so the stripe would tint
# exactly the two appendix rows and read as if it ENCODED that rather than merely counting rows.
#
# The last column (issue #52) is the grammaticality verdict, and it is NOT written out per row:
# each cell is derived from the checker's own result for that transcription, looked up by the
# stem each row names, so the column cannot claim a verdict the checker does not give. The prose
# is shared with the Koren page's table -- see transcription_verdict_column.
