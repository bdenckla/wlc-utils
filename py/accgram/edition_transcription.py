"""Compare a hand transcription of a printed edition's Decalogue against a vendored strand.

The pages in this family (``printed_decalogue_page`` and its Simanim / Koren satellites) place
real editions among the four IDEALIZED Wikisource strands.  Until now that placement rested on
SIGNAL WORDS -- a handful of accents that identify a strand -- which is enough to settle which
strand an edition follows but says nothing about whether it follows it in every accent.  This
module supports the stronger, accent-by-accent claim, by diffing a hand transcription of the
printed accents against the vendored ``in/accgram/printed_decalogue_teamim.json``.

A transcription is primary observation, read off the printed page (see
``in/accgram/edition_transcriptions/``).  It cannot be derived from anything in the repo, so it
is committed input, not generated output.  What this module adds is that the comparison becomes
mechanical and therefore repeatable: a re-vendoring or an upstream Wikisource revision that
moves an accent fails the test rather than silently invalidating prose on a page.

WHAT COUNTS AS ONE TOKEN (the conventions the transcriptions are written to):

* One token per ACCENT, which is normally one token per chanted word, a maqaf compound being
  one chanted word.  The exception is the compound that bears more than one accent -- its
  atoms each accented, which happens but is rare -- written ``mun-mer``, the dash standing for
  the maqaf itself, and contributing two tokens.  SimTiq's Exodus appendix Decalogue has two
  such compounds and they are its most interesting divergences, so this is not hypothetical.
  Contrast ``mun_leg``, where the underscore binds two marks into ONE accent.
* A postpositive or prepositive accent is written TWICE on a chanted word whose stress is not where
  the accent's fixed position puts it -- once at the fixed edge and once on the stressed
  syllable.  That is ONE accent.  ``_accent_tokens`` collapses an immediate repeat of the same
  accent within one chanted word; without this the Exodus elyon alone reports seven phantom
  differences.
* meteg (U+05BD) is dropped: it is not an accent.  Verse-finally the same codepoint is silluq,
  which IS an accent -- emitted, with sof pasuq, as the single token ``silsof``.
* Narrow-sense paseq is not an accent either.  Munax legarmeh is, but in the ACCENT TOKEN
  stream the two are folded together: a munax + U+05C0 is normalized to a plain munax on both
  sides (see ``_LEGARMEH_TOKENS``), so a legarmeh-vs-paseq difference is neither agreement nor
  disagreement THERE.  The kind is checked separately, off to the side of the token diff.  The
  #74 re-vendoring added ``faithful_chanted_verses`` to the source, which keeps the two
  Wikisource templates distinct where the folded ``chanted_verses`` collapses both to U+05C0;
  ``reference_pasoleg_kinds`` reads the reference kind of each stroke back out, so a
  transcription's own legarmeh/paseq claims can be checked against the strand's OWN reference
  rather than only against glyph shape and a cross-tradition nod to MAM-parsed-plus.

WHAT A DIFFERENCE MEANS.  Differences are not all of one weight, but they are all on one
scale, and maqaf is its bottom rung: a maqaf separates the ATOM it sits on from the next even
less than a conjunctive accent does.  So where the two texts put their maqafs differently, that
IS a difference in how the text is marked -- the mildest kind -- and it is counted ONCE, at the
atom whose marking changed, never as a regrouping plus a separate accent.  Both confirmed
differences in the Exodus elyon are of that kind, and so is one of the three in the Exodus
taxton.  Read a difference list alongside the atom it sits on to see which rung it is on: the
pages' verdicts are graded by that, not split into two ledgers.  (The trio briefly did keep two,
declaring a maqaf difference to be no accent difference at all; ``printed_decalogue_strands``'
``MAQAF_IS_THE_LAST_RUNG`` records why that was wrong.)

A maqaf USUALLY takes the place of the joined atom's accent -- an atom standing as its own
chanted word must bear one, while a maqaf-joined proclitic normally takes at most a meteg --
but usually is not always,
and the Exodus taxton is why the weaker word is the right one.  SimTiq prints a munax on the
joined לא of לא־יהיה and of לא־תעשה, whose second atoms carry merkha and qadma -- two accents on
one chanted word, where all eight strands have a meteg.  Those differences are two rungs up,
in the accents themselves, and an earlier version of this note asserted they could not occur.
Neither they nor the elyon's pair touch the disjunctive skeleton or the chanted verse
boundaries, which is the claim that has survived every transcription so far.

HOW RARE THAT IS IN PROSE, AND HOW ORDINARY IN POETRY (Ben, 2026-07-26; the Yeivin references
came from the FULL ITM OCR in ``../yeivin-itm/md-export-of-docx``, which a first pass missed by
searching only the al-hatorah adaptation -- look in both).  Do not read a second accent on a prose
compound as unremarkable.  Two different things put one there, and they license different lists:

* **A SECONDARY ACCENT the compound simply inherits.**  Ben's rule: what turns up on a non-final
  atom is what can be the FIRST OF TWO accents on an ATOMIC word, so the second accent is nothing
  but a consequence of the compound being a single chanted word.  Yeivin's inventory of exactly
  that, under his own term "secondary accent", is short and prose-specific: munax-zaqef (ITM §221,
  frequent enough to count as a fourth variant of the zaqef melody), methiga-zaqef (§224 --
  metigah being in effect a special name for qadma used this way, hence the ``METHIGAZAQEF``
  scanner token, whose middle span deliberately crosses a maqaf), and the rare merkha and mahapakh
  on the word of a tevir (§§233, 241, about five cases apiece).  Ben's rule and Yeivin's list
  agree, which is the useful part; the list is a little longer than "metigah and a few munax".
  (ITM romanizes several of these differently from this repo, so grep the OCR for ITS spellings,
  not ours -- the same trap as Breuer's "hyphen" below.)
* **A MAQAF WRITTEN AFTER A WORD THAT KEEPS ITS OWN CONJUNCTIVE**, which is a manuscript habit and
  not a grammatical category at all.  Yeivin §293: "In a number of MSS, maqqef is occasionally
  marked after a word with a conjunctive accent.  This is most common where the word has
  penultimate stress ... possibly intended to show that the last syllable of the word has no
  accent."  §21 lists it among the features that TELL manuscripts apart, and L -- WLC's own base
  -- is named for doing it: L "marks maqqef after words with conjunctive accents, as ועזר־מצריו
  (Dt 33:7), showing, in this respect, a tradition somewhat different from the standard".  (§357
  is the neighbouring case, a maqaf after a word bearing a ga'ya that follows the accent.)  So an
  accented proclitic in prose is neither unheard-of nor evenly distributed, and WHOSE habit it is
  is part of any question about one.

Two things Yeivin settles for the framing itself, worth not re-deriving.  §291: a maqaf "has no
musical motif of its own, and is therefore not considered an 'accent', either conjunctive or
disjunctive" -- the narrow sense the one-scale reading already concedes.  §292: a maqaf "could be
considered a superfluous sign, since it indicates the absence of any (other) accent sign.  In the
best MSS, however, maqqef is consistently marked after every word which does not have its own
accent" -- so the "atom left blank" GLOSS is Yeivin's own and holds as a near-rule for the best
manuscripts.  It is still not a definition, which is the distinction to keep.

The POETIC system is far more willing to put two accents on one chanted word, and that is
a dramatic difference between the two systems rather than a detail.  Breuer's Chapter 9 gives it
whole sections -- §§20-21 on a mafsik plus a servant, and on two servants, in one word; §§22-26
on the secondary mahapakh/merkha -- and states the rule that governs them: two marks "appear in
one word -- in the same manner in which they are used to appear in two separate words".  He adds
that the maqaf after a secondary merkha is usually OMITTED, so the compound is written as two
words although it is chanted as one, with "but a few cases" where it survives (Job 6:10
ותהי־עוד, Prov 25:20 מעדה־בגד).  Those two are Breuer's restoration rather than the manuscript's
writing -- WLC sets both without a maqaf and MAM with one -- so no maqaf count can measure the
poetic side at all: the asymmetry is real, but it lives in Breuer's argument that an unhyphenated
word still COUNTS as hyphenated, not in anything a scan can see.  So SimTiq's two munax-on-לא are
worth the attention this note gives them, and Koren's ``mun-mun`` on לא־תעשה more still.

HOW OFTEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS is measured, not asserted, and the measurement is NOT here.  The
Tanakh-wide survey lives in ``maqaf_nonfinal_accents`` (+ ``_page``), which writes
``out/accgram/maqaf-nonfinal-accents.json`` and
``gh-pages/accgram/maqaf-nonfinal-accents.html`` from one run, and is where this note's claims
about rarity get their numbers.  Deliberately NO counts here: a number restated in a second file
is a number nothing keeps in step, which is the whole reason the survey was moved out of this
docstring.  What the page settles, qualitatively, is that an accent on a joined atom happens in
well under one percent of prose maqaf compounds; that those cases split into Yeivin's grammatical
secondary accents and §293's bare scribal habit, most of them the former; and that Koren's
``mun-mun`` is NOT unprecedented -- 2 Chr 1:11 ויאמר־אלהים ׀ לשלמה is the same shape doing the
same job before a pazer -- but that its precedent is a MANUSCRIPT one, no printed edition being
known to have done it, SimTiq's munax on the joined לא being the nearest printed thing there is.
Read the page before restating any of that: it carries the corpus caveats that bound every one of
those findings, and the survey module's docstring carries the method.

WHAT THE TOKEN STREAM CANNOT SEE.  One token per ACCENT means a maqaf leaves no token of its
own, so a maqaf difference registers only through the accent count it changes.  Where an
edition joins two atoms and accents BOTH of them in the resulting compound -- ``koren_dt_elyon``'s
mun-mun on לא־תעשה -- the two sides emit identical tokens and the diff sees nothing.  Such a
difference is recorded by hand in the transcription's ``.txt`` and stated in the page's verdict
cell.  Making maqaf a token of its own would close the gap; that is issue #75, left undone here
because it touches every transcription and the reference derivation alike.

That claim is true and NOT the whole story, which is why ``transcription_parse`` exists
(issue #52).  An intact skeleton is a token-identity fact and says nothing about whether the
resulting sequence parses: the munax on the joined לא of לא־תעשה makes three servi before the
pashta where the grammar takes two, so that chanted verse is ungrammatical under the prose
checker even though every one of the page's divergences is conjunctive.
