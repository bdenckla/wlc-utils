"""Genre filter for the prose accent grammar.

The prose grammar cannot parse the 3-poetic-accent system, so verses using
poetic cantillation must be excluded before they reach the parser: Psalms and
Proverbs wholesale, poetically-cantillated Job verses, and a few verses the BHS
versification hard-codes (the Decalogue ranges and Gn 35:22). This is the genre
filter, extracted from the former filter_split_wlc with the (now removed)
hardcoded-troublemaker check dropped.
