r"""Feed a hand transcription's accents to the prose grammar checker (issue #52).

``printed_decalogue`` grammar-checks the eight IDEALIZED Wikisource strands: fed through
accgram's prose checker, are the printed- and manuscript-tradition Decalogue accentuations
grammatical?  This module asks the same question of what a REAL EDITION prints, by running
the committed hand transcriptions (``edition_transcription``) through the identical pipeline
-- ``printed_decalogue.parse_marks_body``, so the same scanner, the same grammar and the same
status vocabulary answer both.  Both Decalogues are prose; the poetic checker never applies.

WHY A TRANSCRIPTION CAN BE PARSED AT ALL.  A transcription is a stream of accent shorthand
(``mun``, ``zaq``, ``mun_leg``, ``qad+ger``, ``mun-mer``) and the scanner is described as
reading Hebrew text, so an adapter looked as though it might need pointed text the
transcription never captured.  It does not, because the scanner does not read pointed text
either: ``uni_to_marks`` first reduces a verse to a MARK BODY, in which every base letter is
one opaque placeholder and only accents, meteg, paseq, maqaf, space and sof pasuq survive.  A
transcription already records that alphabet minus meteg, so the body is built straight from
it -- one placeholder letter per accent, plus the punctuation the transcription does record.

DROPPING METEG IS HARMLESS, not merely tolerable.  Meteg's M-C digit set (``75``) blocks none
of the four trailing-context lookaheads the scanner rebuilds over the mark alphabet (see
``accent_marks.negated_class``), so its absence cannot change prose tokenization.  The one
place it is load-bearing is the verse-final silluq, and a transcription records that directly
as ``silsof``.  The claim is checked rather than asserted: for every transcription that
diverges from its Wikisource strand NOWHERE, the body built here reproduces that strand's scanner
token stream exactly, positional calls included -- azla vs. qadma, methiga-zaqef, mayela,
legarmeh, and the fused stress-helper pashta and telisha.  See ``test_edition_transcriptions``.

WHAT THIS ADDS OVER THE TOKEN DIFF.  ``edition_transcription.compare`` scores a divergence
accent by accent, and the test module pins whether it leaves the disjunctive skeleton intact.
Both are token-IDENTITY claims; neither says whether the resulting accent sequence is
GRAMMATICAL, and one divergence shows the two come apart.  SimTiq's Exodus appendix taxton
(p. 246) diverges from its Wikisource strand only in conjunctives -- the skeleton is untouched,
which is correct and pinned -- and its third chanted verse is ungrammatical all the same: the
page's
munax on the joined לא of לא־תעשה makes three servi where the grammar takes two, and the
pashta phrase fails.  That chanted verse is ungrammatical without qualification -- a fact about
the accent sequence, not an artifact of this checker.  It is not a verdict that the edition is
in error, and a clean rate is not the objective.

WHAT IT DOES NOT ADD is the legarmeh-vs-paseq distinction, which was once the reason to want
it.  The scanner's LEGARMEH call is purely POSITIONAL -- a munax + U+05C0 before a revia --
so it is blind to which kind an edition prints, exactly as the pre-#74 vendored data was.
The converse is what is worth having: BECAUSE the call is positional, the scanner supplies a
kind where an edition withholds one, which is the whole stroke inventory of the four Koren
transcriptions (Koren has the bar without saying which it is, so every one of its strokes
is transcribed ``[pasoleg]``, kind unspecified, and the round-trip against the reference
compares none of them).  ``scanner_pasoleg_kinds`` is that determination.

WHERE THE VERDICTS ARE RECORDED.  ``TranscriptionResult`` pairs each transcription's verdicts
with the strand's own, chanted verse by chanted verse, and ``payload_objs`` serializes them as
the ``transcriptions`` section of ``out/accgram/printed-decalogue/_printed_decalogue.json``,
beside the ``versions`` section holding the strands'.  The rendered statement of the same
verdicts is a column on each satellite page's per-Decalogue verdict table, whose shared prose
lives in ``transcription_verdict_column``.
