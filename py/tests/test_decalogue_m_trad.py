"""Issue #68: the m-trad Decalogue strands agree between the repo's two copies of them.

The printed-Decalogue page trio (``printed_decalogue_page`` and its Koren and Simanim
satellites, via ``printed_decalogue_strands``) takes MAM's manuscript tradition as its
authoritative baseline and states facts about it as ground truth.  Those pages read the
vendored ``in/accgram/printed_decalogue_teamim.json``; MAM's own parse of the same text
lives one repo over in MAM-parsed's ``plus`` tree.  Nothing tied the two together, so a
re-vendoring or an upstream Wikisource edit could have moved a word or a stroke and left
the pages asserting something MAM does not say.

The answer is that they agree exactly -- all four (book, reading) strands, every chanted
verse, every word, every vertical stroke, with no exceptions to enumerate.  The single
respect in which the two sources are not byte-identical is the ORDER of a letter's own
marks (see ``decalogue_m_trad``'s docstring): MAM-parsed-plus keeps MAM's order, the
Wikisource base page is canonically ordered.  ``test_words_differ_only_by_mark_order``
pins that down independently of the canonical reading ``compare`` does, so the day the two
sources really do diverge, that is not where it hides.

# NOTHING HERE SKIPS ON A MISSING SOURCE, deliberately.  Both sides of the comparison are
# supposed to be on disk -- the vendored one is committed in this repo, and the MAM-parsed
# clone is a hard dependency of the check, not an optional enrichment -- so an absent one is
# a misconfiguration.  Skipping would report green having compared nothing, in the very
# channel this suite reserves for SEMANTIC skips (see test_edition_transcriptions' "diverges
# from its Wikisource strand; the control needs an agreeing page").  ``repo_paths.require_sibling``
# turns the sibling's absence into a failure that names the two overrides that fix it.

# Per strand: chanted verses, chanted words, and the kind of every vertical stroke in
# reading order.  Derived from MAM-parsed-plus and equally true of the vendored side --
# pinned here so a change that moved both in step still has to be looked at.  The verse
# counts are the same ones printed_decalogue_strands.STRUCTURE pins for Exodus.
