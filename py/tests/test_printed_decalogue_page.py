"""Issue #52: the printed-Decalogue grammaticality page (printed-decalogue.html).

Covers the page-1-specific machinery the Simanim test does not: that the whole body builds
(exercising the ``printed_decalogue_strands`` drift assertions AND the four-strands table's
per-cell check that a word's sof pasuq agrees with whether its strand ends a chanted verse
there), that the two signal words identify the strands, and that ``_strip_pointing`` keeps the
cantillation signal (accents + sof pasuq) while dropping vowels, MAM-simple style.

Skips if the vendored source JSON is absent (regenerate via printed_decalogue_fetch.py).

Run:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest py/tests/test_printed_decalogue_page.py -v
