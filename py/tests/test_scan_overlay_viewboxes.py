"""Every highlight overlay's viewBox equals its scan's real pixel size.

WHY THIS IS WORTH A TEST.  ``my_html_for_img.Box(x, y, w, h)`` coordinates are in the
committed PNG's own pixel space, and ``scan_figure``'s ``viewbox=(w, h)`` declares what that
space is.  Nothing checked the two against each other, and every way of getting it wrong is
SILENT: the page still builds, ``pin_claims`` still agrees, the whole suite still passes, and
the only symptom is highlight rectangles sitting off the words they mean to mark -- a defect
visible solely to someone who opens the page and looks.  A rescanned or recropped image is
the obvious way in, since it changes the pixel space without touching the module that names
it, and the two literals live in different places in the page module.

THE SHAPE.  A mechanical lint over the tree -- one of the two kinds of test that have ever
found anything here (``doc/agent-planning-principles.md`` SS"Generated Outputs Are the
Tests") -- decidable from the committed artifacts alone: does this viewBox equal
``Image.open(scan).size``?

PAIRED OFF THE RENDERED HTML, NOT THE PAGE MODULES.  The pairing is what makes this
checkable, and the HTML is where it already exists as one object: a ``<div class=
"scan-annot">`` holds the ``<img src=...>`` and the ``<svg ... viewBox="0 0 W H">`` side by
side, so the src resolves against the page's own directory and no import, no AST walk and no
naming convention is involved.  In the modules the two are separate top-level names -- an
``_*_IMG`` filename constant and an ``_*_VIEWBOX`` tuple that some call sites do not bother
to name at all -- with nothing but adjacency in the call to connect them.  Checking the HTML
also checks the artifact that actually ships, which is the thing a reader's browser lays out.

SO IT DISCOVERS ITS OWN WORK.  Every ``gh-pages/**/*.html`` is parsed; a page that grows an
overlay later is covered without anyone registering it, and a page whose overlay is removed
drops out on its own.  As of this writing ten figures on the three accgram pages qualify.
