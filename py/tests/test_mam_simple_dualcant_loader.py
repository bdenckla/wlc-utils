"""Stage-1 of issue #36: the MAM-simple loader exposes the two detangled threads.

A ``cant-all-three`` span carries three single-cantillation projections
(``cant-combined`` / ``cant-alef`` / ``cant-bet``).  The loader must surface
``cant-alef`` and ``cant-bet`` as their own position-correct token streams,
interleaved with the single-cant ``text`` around the span -- not naively concatenate
all three (the pre-#36 behaviour, which tripled the dual span).

Gen 35:22 is the canonical mid-verse span: a single-cant prefix, the dual span, then a
single-cant suffix.  Its alef thread closes a chanted verse mid–numbered-verse (silluq +
sof pasuq on ישראל) and opens a second on the suffix; its bet thread runs the whole
numbered verse as one chanted verse (atnaX on ישראל, no sof pasuq).  This is exactly what
the detangler segments on.

Run:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest py/tests/test_mam_simple_dualcant_loader.py -v
