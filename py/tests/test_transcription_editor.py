"""Tests for the per-line transcription editor's crop diagnostics.

``crop_warnings`` exists because both ways of misplacing a vertical crop are SILENT: the debug
overlay draws a plausible band for a clipped line and for a merged one alike.  The numbers
below are the real ones from Koren A5-D-281, where both mistakes were made in one sitting.

BLESSED EXAMPLE-BASED FILE (issue #88).  The hand-picked band geometries, the synthesized row
profiles and the drawn pages are all the shape ``doc/agent-planning-principles.md`` otherwise
forbids.  Kept, because these diagnostics have no oracle to differ against and produce no
tracked output to diff: the input is a scan, the failure is silent by construction, and the only
statable check is that a page shaped like the one that broke yields the warning it should.  The
synthetic profiles are scaled versions of that real page precisely so the numbers stay readable
as the page, not as magic constants.
