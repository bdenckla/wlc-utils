"""Issue #62: the Simanim-Decalogue page (printed-decalogue-simanim.html).

The four cantillation strands of the opening אנכי…מצותי span are derived live from the vendored
``in/accgram/printed_decalogue_teamim.json`` by the shared ``printed_decalogue_strands`` module:
for each Exodus reading it reads the first chanted verse and derives the accent on אנכי (first
word) and עבדים.  These tests pin that derivation (which now lives on the strands module, not on
this page) and confirm the Simanim page body renders.

Skips if the vendored source JSON is absent (regenerate via printed_decalogue_fetch.py).

Run:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest py/tests/test_printed_decalogue_simanim.py -v
