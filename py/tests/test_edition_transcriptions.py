#
# SimTiq's Exodus main Decalogue (elyon, pp. 83-84) diverges from the Wikisource p-trad elyon
# at exactly two points, and BOTH are word-division differences rather than cantillation
# choices -- SimTiq splits a maqaf compound the reference joins, and joins one the reference
# splits.  The conjunctive/meteg marking then follows mechanically, because a maqaf-joined
# proclitic cannot bear an accent while a free-standing word must:
#
#   * ובנך ובתך (Shabbat commandment): reference joins them under one telisha gedola, so ובנך
#     takes a meteg and no accent; SimTiq sets them as two words, so ובנך takes a munax.
#     SimTiq's reading here is attested by none of the eight Wikisource strands.
#   * לא תחמד בית (tenth commandment): reference sets לא free with its own merkha; SimTiq
#     joins it by maqaf, so לא takes a meteg and no accent.  All four Exodus strands agree
#     with the reference here, so it is SimTiq that diverges.
#
# The two cancel in the token count (+1 munax, -1 merkha), which is why the totals match at
# 142 despite two real divergences.  Do not read equal totals as agreement.
#
# RE-TRANSCRIBED 2026-07-22 with the line editor, this file having been the last one with no
# committed export, and the divergence set came back UNCHANGED -- the same two regions, token
# for token, from an independent second reading of the same pages.  What the redo did add is the
# audit trail (so every export-based test below now covers this stem too) and the pasoleg KINDS,
# which the first transcription's conventions had dropped: SimTiq distinguishes the two, and
# the four strokes split 2 narrow paseq (16 פסל, 19 בשמים) and 2 legarmeh (25 במים, 75 שבת),
# each landing on its exact reference position.
#
# Words are pinned by LETTER SKELETON (``pds.base_skeleton``), not by their pointed form: the

    # strand joins.  The יהיה split is Koren-alone: no vendored strand separates יהיה־לך and

    """What the parser adds that #74 could not: a kind for a kind-agnostic edition.

    Koren prints the vertical without saying which kind it is, so every one of its strokes is
    transcribed ``[pasoleg]`` -- kind unspecified, asserting nothing the book does not -- and
    ``test_transcription_pasoleg_kinds_round_trip_against_the_reference`` therefore compares
    ZERO strokes for all four Koren stems.  The scanner's positional rule determines all
    fourteen, and they agree with the vendored reference.  Both facts are asserted here: that
    the transcription states no kind, so the determination is not a restatement of one, and
    that the round trip really does compare nothing for this stem.
