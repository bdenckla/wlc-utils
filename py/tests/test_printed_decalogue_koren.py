"""The Koren-Decalogue page (printed-decalogue-koren.html).

Companion to ``test_printed_decalogue_simanim``. The four-strands derivation itself is pinned by
that test and by ``printed_decalogue_strands``; here we only confirm the Koren page body renders
and that its scans are committed.

The vendored source JSON is committed here, so these FAIL rather than skip if it is absent --
see ``test_printed_decalogue``'s docstring and ``repo_paths.require_sibling``.

Run:

    Like the Simanim page it needs the grammar-check results, for the verdict table's last column
    (issue #52): each cell is the checker's verdict for one transcription against its Wikisource
    strand's, so a row naming a stem with no committed transcription fails here, on the lookup.

    The results are now passed in their own right rather than only relayed to the transcription
    check: the verdict table states how many ways the two Deuteronomy תחתון strands part, derived
    live by ``printed_decalogue_taxton_diff``, which raises unless the divergence set is still the
    pinned one -- so building the body also exercises that derivation.
