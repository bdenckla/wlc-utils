"""``final_stress`` against Phonetic MAM: a differential check with an independent oracle.

``accgram.final_stress`` decides whether a chanted word is stressed on its last syllable by
counting nuclei and locating one syllable, the last.  al-hatorah's ``py/aht_phon`` decides the same
thing with a real stress model -- full syllabification plus a hand-built table saying which accent
of a vector bears the stress -- and has already run it over the whole Tanakh.  So the two are
independent derivations of one fact, which is the shape of test this repo keeps
(``doc/agent-planning-principles.md`` §"Generated Outputs Are the Tests").  Issue #48 calls
consuming Phonetic MAM's outputs its second path; this is that path, and it is why the rule in
``final_stress`` is measured against the engine rather than standing in for it.

WHAT IS CHECKED: every chanted word of MAM's PROSE verses the maqaf-non-final-accents survey gives
a final-stress verdict for -- the simple two-accent chanted words and the concentrators, minus the
ones the survey excludes, minus the ones whose last mark is written at the chanted word's edge and
so says nothing about stress.  MAM, because Phonetic MAM is MAM; prose, because the page the
measurement is for is about prose verses and because a poetic chanted word's atoms really are
grouped differently on the two sides -- MAM has a gray maqaf in 113 places where Phonetic MAM keeps
two chanted words, and those 113 are nearly the whole of what will not join anywhere in MAM's
Tanakh.  The rest of it, 11 more (issue #91), is outside this test's reach for reasons of its own:
8 dually-cantillated chanted words in the two Decalogues, whose ``cant-combined`` projection is
neither strand; Deuteronomy 32:6, where MAM's large ה stands apart from לְיְהֹוָה֙ and Phonetic MAM
has one entry for the two atoms; and 2 Chronicles 25:17, where Phonetic MAM has לְךָ֖ against the
qere לְכָ֖ה that MAM-simple and WLC 4.22 both have, which is a difference in the text rather than
in the grouping.  The
scan is rerun here rather than read out of the survey's JSON, which keeps counts and not words --
and rerun over MAM's own versification, for which see ``_measured``.

THE ORACLE'S FORM: ``io/a01-phonetic-std-set/<book>.json`` maps a short verse key to the verse's
chanted words; each has ``fva``, whose first space-separated field is the fully pointed chanted
word, and ``jta``, an ASCII phonetic form where ``.`` separates syllables, ``-`` separates the atoms
of a maqaf compound, and ``!`` immediately precedes the stressed syllable.  So the stress is on the
last syllable when nothing but that syllable follows the ``!`` -- see ``_stress_is_final`` for the
one place the two sides count syllables differently and what is done about it.

A DUAL-CANTILLATION chanted word has one entry per strand and the two can disagree -- Exodus 20's
lo-yihye is stressed differently in each -- so a verdict matching either strand is agreement.  The
survey reads one strand of MAM-simple, and which one is not a fact this test is about.

A word Phonetic MAM has no entry for FAILS, and none does: the join over the prose measured set is
exceptionless since issue #91, whose fix is why -- see the test's own docstring for the one word
that used to be pinned here.  A skip is this suite's semantic channel and an environment skip mixed
into it reports green having verified nothing; the same is why the sibling clone is required rather
than skipped around.
