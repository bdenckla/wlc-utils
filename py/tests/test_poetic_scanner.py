"""Tests for the poetic (Three Books) scanner.

Pins the decoded token stream of a few real Psalms verses whose Michigan-Claremont
encoding was checked by hand against the M-C accent table (wlc420/supplmt.wts,
column II) and Yeivin ITM #358-374.  These exercise the tricky cases: the
revia mugrash geresh muqdam (11+81), oleh-we-yored (60 ole + 71 yored merkha),
azla/mahapakh legarmeh (63/70 + 05 paseq), the galgal servus of oleh-we-yored
(93), and the revia gadol/qatan/mugrash disambiguation.

Token-type names come from accgram.poetic_accent_names (no re-typed literals).

Run:
