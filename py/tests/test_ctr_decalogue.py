"""Pin CTR's two Decalogues against the reference strands (issue #73).

CTR (The Complete Tanach with Rashi, chabad.org) is a VENDORED STRAND, not a hand
transcription: digital, accent-exact Hebrew, compared at the GLYPH level because its encoding
cannot distinguish the lookalike accent pairs a reader resolves by grammar (see
``accgram/ctr_decalogue.py``).  These tests pin the surprise the comparison found and guard it
against a re-fetch or a re-vendoring that would quietly change it:

* CTR's Exodus 20 has the ta'am ELYON accents (not the taxton expected of a running text) under
  a punctuation that is neither strand's: sixteen sof pasuqs, the union of the two strands'
  boundaries.  Only nine of the sixteen spans have a silluq, so only nine are chanted verses --
  say SOF PASUQ SPAN for the rest, which is what makes the finding statable at all (a real
  re-division would have moved the silluqs, and silluq is an accent).
* CTR's Deuteronomy 5 is the taxton, division and all: thirteen spans, all with a silluq.

Every residual difference from the followed strand is CONJUNCTIVE -- the disjunctive skeleton,
which is what #69 claims survives, is intact in both books.

Skips if either vendored JSON is absent (regenerate via ctr_decalogue_fetch.py /
printed_decalogue_fetch.py).
