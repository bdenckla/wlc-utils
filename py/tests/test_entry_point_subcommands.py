"""Guard: each entry point's ``Subcommands:`` docstring block matches its parser.

A ``py/main_<x>.py`` that registers subcommands documents them twice: once in the
``argparse`` parser, and once by hand in the module docstring, which is also the
``--help`` description.  Nothing kept the two in step, so they drifted --
``run-printed-decalogue`` was registered but never listed, and ``--help`` therefore
described eleven of ``main_accgram.py``'s twelve subcommands (fixed in ``cb96f55``).
That is the same silent-drift class as a hand-maintained test registry: the
undocumented subcommand still works, so only a reader notices, and only by accident.

This is a mechanical lint over the tree, the second of the two test shapes
``doc/agent-planning-principles.md`` sanctions: both sides are derived from the source,
so adding, renaming or deleting a subcommand never needs this file edited.

WHAT IT CHECKS

* ``test_every_subcommand_is_documented_and_every_entry_registered`` -- the two name
  sets agree in both directions.  A name deleted from the parser but left in the
  docstring is the same defect running the other way.
* ``test_a_pattern_entry_spells_out_every_family_member`` -- an entry ending in
  ``<name>`` is a pattern, not a literal: ``main_accgram.py``'s
  ``generate-html-<name>`` stands for the thirteen subcommands derived from its
  ``_HTML_GENERATORS`` table.  Such an entry covers every registered name sharing its
  prefix, and its own prose then has to name each of them -- that entry spells out
  "The full set: generate-html-poetic, -goerwitz, ...", a second hand-maintained list
  with the same capacity to drift, so each family member must appear there either in
  full or as the ``-<suffix>`` shorthand that list uses.

HOW AN ENTRY POINT IS FOUND, AND WHY NOTHING HERE SKIPS

Discovery reads the source of every ``py/main_*.py`` and keeps the ones calling
``add_subparsers``: an entry point with no subcommands has nothing to check and simply
never enters the parameter list.  Everything past that point FAILS rather than skips --
a discovered entry point with no ``build_parser()`` and one with no ``Subcommands:``
block are both failures, and the ``or [...]`` fallback on the parametrize is what makes
an empty discovery fail too (pytest reports an empty parameter set as a SKIP).  Skips
are a semantic channel in this suite, reserved for reporting that a page diverges from
its strand; an environment-shaped skip mixed in corrupts that signal.
