"""The non-final-atom page (maqaf-nonfinal-accents.html) -- its committed scans.

A tree lint, one of the two test shapes this repo blesses: the page references its two figures by
relative path, so a scan that never reached ``gh-pages/accgram/img/`` gives a broken image on a
page that says nothing is wrong. Same shape as ``test_printed_decalogue_koren``'s
``test_scan_images_committed`` and its Simanim twin, down to naming the files outright.

Everything else about this page is checked by regenerating it: one run of
``main_accgram.py generate-html-maqaf-nonfinal-accents`` writes both the JSON and the HTML, and
``maqaf_nonfinal_accents_page.pin_claims`` re-derives every stated claim and raises on drift.

Run:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_test.py py/tests/test_maqaf_nonfinal_accents_page.py
