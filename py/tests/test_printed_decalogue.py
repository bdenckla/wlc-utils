"""Issue #52: grammar-check the printed-tradition Decalogue accentuations.

Feeds the eight vendored Decalogue readings ({Exodus, Deuteronomy} x {taxton, elyon} x
{manuscript, printed}) through the prose grammar and pins the verdict, and then pins the
``transcriptions`` section in which the output file records the same verdict for the twelve
hand-transcribed real editions:

  * every taxton chanted verse parses clean, both books and both traditions;
  * the manuscript elyon parses clean in both books (MAM's own authoritative text);
  * the *printed* elyon of *each* Decalogue has exactly one ungrammatical chanted verse --
    its opening verse, where the printed tradition merges the first two commandments into a
    single verse (nine verses total vs the manuscript's ten). That merged verse is far the
    longest of its version.

Skips if the vendored source JSON is absent (regenerate via printed_decalogue_fetch.py).

Run:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest py/tests/test_printed_decalogue.py -v
