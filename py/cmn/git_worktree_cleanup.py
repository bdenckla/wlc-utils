"""Remove finished agent git worktrees and the branches they left behind.

Agent sessions that run in isolation create a worktree plus, usually, a matching
``claude/<name>`` branch, and clean up neither when the session ends, so both
accumulate: at the time this module was written wlc-utils carried two orphaned
worktrees and three orphaned branches, every one of them clean and already
merged into main.  They are not harmless clutter -- a worktree is a second full
checkout, and a stale one is a place where a later session can do real work in
the wrong tree.

TWO LOCATIONS, BOTH IN SCOPE.  The harness default is
``<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>``, whose nesting depth breaks the
``../<sibling>`` lookups that this repo's cross-repo code depends on (see
``repo_paths``).  The workaround for that is a worktree placed as a SIBLING of
the repo instead, ``GitRepos/wlc-utils-<topic>``, where those lookups resolve --
a deliberate practice, not a mistake, and the one that accumulates in the more
annoying place.  Removal is driven off ``git worktree list``, so it covers both
without caring which is which.  The empty-husk sweep below is the sole exception
and stays confined to ``.claude/worktrees/``: it deletes directories by
enumeration rather than by asking git, which is safe inside a directory that
exists only to hold worktrees and would not be safe loose in ``GitRepos``.

REMOVAL IS CONSERVATIVE, AND NEVER USES ``--force``.  Several conditions each
spare a worktree, and every spared one is reported with its reason rather than
passed over in silence:

- The main worktree (the repo clone itself) is never a candidate.
- Neither is whichever worktree is running this code -- an agent housekeeping
  its own checkout must not delete the ground it stands on.
- A worktree locked with ``git worktree lock`` is skipped.  That is git's own
  sanctioned "leave this alone" flag and the right way to protect a worktree
  indefinitely; ``git worktree remove`` refuses a locked one, so never passing
  ``--force`` honours it automatically.  It is still checked explicitly, so a
  deliberately locked worktree reports as a considered decision instead of
  failing noisily every single run.
- A worktree with recent git activity is skipped -- see
  ``_seconds_since_activity``.
- A worktree with any uncommitted change, tracked or untracked, is left alone,
  as is one whose HEAD is not an ancestor of the default branch.  Untracked
  files count deliberately: git's own ``worktree remove`` refuses on them too,
  and in a repo whose real deliverables are generated files, an unexpected
  untracked file is exactly the kind of thing worth looking at before it is
  destroyed.

Branch deletion is likewise narrow.  Only branches under ``claude/`` are
considered -- the prefix the agent harness uses -- so a topic branch created by
hand is never a candidate however merged it may be.  Deletion goes through
``git branch -d``, which refuses an unmerged branch on its own; the ancestor
check here is for the report, not for safety.

Worktrees are removed before branches, because a branch checked out in a
worktree cannot be deleted while that worktree exists.  That ordering matters
in practice: the worktree and the branch it holds often do not share a name.

THE CASE THE ACTIVITY CHECK EXISTS FOR is a worktree another session is using
right now.  Git has no notion of a worktree being "in use", so this cannot be
known, only estimated.  The dirty check catches nearly all of it and is not a
theoretical safeguard: a concurrent session held ``wlc-utils-decalogue-claims``
while this module was being written, sitting exactly on the default branch's
tip, and nine modified files plus one untracked new module are the only reason
it was spared.  What that leaves is a narrow window -- a live session momentarily
between commits, with a clean tree -- which is what ``_seconds_since_activity``
closes.

Be exact about the stakes rather than alarmed: a clean, fully-merged worktree
holds nothing that does not also exist in the repo, so what a wrong removal
costs is the session's workspace, never its work.

Do NOT count the operating system as a further line of defence.  An earlier
version of this docstring did, on the grounds that a held file handle makes the
removal fail -- true on Windows, but it fails LATE.  Git deletes the worktree's
contents and only then cannot unlink the directory, which is exactly how the
husk that ``_sweep_empty_dirs`` now collects came to exist.  A held handle turns
a silent removal into a noisy one; it does not prevent it.
