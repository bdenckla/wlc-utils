# BY TAG, deliberately, and that is a real (small) change from what came before.  Each row
# below was read off the six now-deleted htel_mk* variants its tags used to be built with,
# and an AST scan of every such call in py/ found no tag built two ways.  (The one that
# was, `br`, took its inline row from `line_break`; the other constructor, `line_break2`,
# had no callers at all and is gone.)
#
# BUT that scan does not see every htel.  The two replayed Psalms-17:14 bodies
# (ps17v14_mam_doc_notes_body, ps17v14_double_tsinnor_body), migrated byte-exactly from
# hand-authored HTML, write their htels as LITERAL dicts.  Those pin lb1/lb2 on inline
# tags but leave block tags unpinned, so h1/p/blockquote/figure/figcaption/img there used
# to take the old el_to_str default of lb1="\n" -- disagreeing with the rows below, which
# give those tags lb1="".  So a tag table cannot reproduce those two pages byte-for-byte,
# and it does not: they lose a newline after those block-level open tags, which no browser
# renders and which brings them into line with the other 151 pages.  Ben took that trade
# knowingly (2026-07-30) rather than keep a per-element override alive for two pages; the
# alternative would have kept the per-element lb1/lb2 fields (the former `HelDetails`)
# load-bearing forever instead of letting them be deleted.  Do not "restore" it.
#
# Also do NOT "harmonize" these with MAM-basics' tables next to its own writer -- they
# genuinely disagree on h2, h3, li, tr and pre, and adopting those values would rewrap all
# 153 tracked pages for no reason.  Two repos sharing one algorithm is the point; sharing a
