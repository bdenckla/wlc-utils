"""Edit a GitHub issue body without letting a file become the source of truth.

Editing an issue by hand goes: fetch the body to a scratch file, edit the file, push it back
with ``gh issue edit --body-file``.  The trap is the gap between fetch and push.  Anything that
touched the issue in between is silently reverted, and nothing in the mechanism notices --
``gh`` will happily write a body captured an hour and three edits ago.  Scratch snapshots also
accumulate under near-identical names (``issue69_body.md`` beside ``issue_69_body.md``), so a
later session cannot tell which one is current and picks wrong.

The cure is not tidier filenames.  It is to stop the file being the source: fetch, mutate in
memory, and push, all in ONE process, so the body written back is derived from the body just
read.  The file this module writes is a byproduct -- one fixed path per issue, overwritten
every time, valuable only for reading back what was sent::

    from issue_edit import fetch_body, replace_once, write_and_edit

    body = fetch_body(69)
    body = replace_once(body, anchor, anchor + addition)
    write_and_edit(69, body)

:func:`replace_once` is what actually makes this safe.  A plain ``str.replace`` that matches
nothing returns the string unchanged, so a stale anchor -- the exact symptom of someone else
having edited the issue -- sails through and the edit silently does nothing.  Matching twice is
just as bad in the other direction.  So the anchor must match exactly once or it raises.

Bodies are fetched through ``gh --json`` and decoded as UTF-8 from captured output.  Never pipe
issue text through a subprocess's stdin: Python decodes stdin with ``surrogateescape``, and a
lone surrogate from Hebrew text then raises on re-encode -- which has silently pushed an empty
body to a GitHub issue before.
