"""Printed-edition transcription workflow.

The interactive, machine-local half of the printed-Decalogue work: it reads a personal scan
archive outside the repo (see WLC_SCANS_DIR) and writes disposable renderings to the
gitignored .novc/scans/.  Kept apart from main_accgram.py deliberately -- that entry point is
corpus runs and page generation, which need no scans and produce tracked output.

Subcommands:
    scan-page
                Render one page (or several) of a book scan, downscaled to something
                readable, to .novc/scans/<stem>.png.  --crop takes four fractions of
                the page in 0..1, left top right bottom, applied before the resize, so
                a quarter-page crop at the same --width doubles the effective
                resolution -- which is what makes merkha vs. meteg legible.  --name
                sets the output stem, so successive crops of one page do not overwrite
                each other, and therefore refuses more than one page.
    editor
                Build a per-line transcription editor over one page, to
                .novc/scans/<stem>-editor.html: the page image with a text field that
                follows the line being transcribed down it, so the eye never leaves
                that line.  --crop's L and R bound the text column, while its T and B
                name the LINES TO TRANSCRIBE -- band detection runs over a region grown
                about a line past them, so a boundary line is never clipped and its
                neighbours come through dimmed as context.  --debug also writes
                <stem>-lines.png with the detected bands drawn on the page.
    zoom-line
                Crop one printed line (or several, or with no line numbers all of
                them) out of the scan a line editor export was read from, padded so
                no accent can be clipped, and echo that line's transcribed text.  The
                band comes from the export's own px_source coordinates, so the zoom is
                anchored to what was transcribed.
    check
                Check a hand transcription against its vendored Wikisource strand, before
                it is committed: name the editor's downloaded export(s) as paths and the
                strand with --key BOOK STRAND KIND, or name an already committed
                transcription with --stem, which takes its strand from the .txt header.
                --site SKELETON NEXT_SKELETON asks a different question -- what every
                strand does at one site, located by the letter skeleton of a word and of
                the word after it.
    build
                Wrap the editor's export(s) into the committed JSON and derive the .txt
                body beneath its hand-written header, which this never rewrites.
                --derive-only re-derives that body from the already-committed JSON, and
                --check writes nothing at all: it re-derives every committed stem and
                exits non-zero if any .txt is not its own derived body.
    highlight-picker
                Build a page for dragging highlight rectangles over a committed scan
                under gh-pages/accgram/img/, to .novc/highlight-picker-<image>.html, and
                export their coordinates for pasting into a page generator.  Authoring
                only: nothing it makes ships, and the page generators hold its output as
                ``mhi.Box`` px boxes.  --boxes-file seeds it with boxes to tweak.

The output is only ever written.  To put a rendering in front of the reader, hand over a
``file:///`` link to it and open nothing -- no Start-Process, no browser pane.

Examples:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_edition_transcription.py scan-page \
        "Feldheim Simanim Tiqqun" C246 --width 1100
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_edition_transcription.py scan-page \
        "Feldheim Simanim Tiqqun" C246 --crop 0.5 0 1 1 --name C246-right
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_edition_transcription.py editor \
        "Feldheim Simanim Tiqqun" C246 --crop 0.5 0.30 1 0.45 --name C246-v --debug
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_edition_transcription.py zoom-line \
        in/accgram/edition_transcriptions/simtiq_ex_taxton.json 12 13
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe py/main_edition_transcription.py check \
        --stem simtiq_dt_elyon
